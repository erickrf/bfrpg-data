The target must save vs. Spells or be utterly dominated by the aboleth's mental power. An enslaved creature will obey the aboleth's telepathic commands. Such a creature can attempt a new save vs. Spells every 24 hours to break free, or can be freed by a <strong>remove curse</strong> spell. The control is also broken if the aboleth dies or is separated from its slave by more than a mile.",

Continuous and repeated exposure to the slime slowly transforms the creature into a skum. The transformation takes about a month.",

It has a slimy, scaly skin and a finned tail used for swimming. A skum attacks with its teeth and razor-sharp claws, or with any weapon provided by its master. Skum have darkvision with a range of 60 feet. They have the same breathing capabilities (and limitations) described above.",

An aerial servant can locate and track target creatures in much the same way as an invisible stalker. Because it is invisible and fairly quiet, it surprises on 1-4 on 1d6, and combatants who are unable to see it suffer the usual penalty for attacking an invisible opponent.",

A creature can be grabbed by means of a normal attack roll, and once grabbed in this way, only a very strong victim (18 Strength, or 4 or more hit dice) has any chance of escape; such a victim has a base 25% chance to escape, with a 10% bonus to their chance, per additional hit die in excess of 4. Creatures weighing more than 1,000 pounds can be grabbed but cannot be moved, and after a few rounds the aerial servant will give up.",

      "The arboreal Aeromi is a fur-covered humanoid about 4 to 5 feet in height with a long bushy tail. It has relatively long limbs ending in claws; they are primarily used for climbing, but make for formidable weapons as well. It is quite dexterous (accounting for the armor class). An aeromi has stretchable skin between its upper and lower limbs and along the side of its body (a patagium) that allows it to glide effectively between trees. This patagium is not continuous but instead is anchored in key points on its body. It speaks its own language that includes various clicks and chittering, but many also speak Common to some degree.",
      "Aeromi are nocturnal and have Darkvision to a range of 90' when outdoors, even on the darkest of nights. On a clear night with ample star- or moonlight, an aeromi can see nearly as well as a human can in daylight. In indoor areas or underground the aeromi can see with Darkvision out to 30 feet. An aeromi suffers a -1 attack penalty in bright sunlight or within the radius of a<strong> light </strong>spell.",
      "An aeromi climbs readily among the massive redwood and sequoia trees that it lives among. Aeromi villages are built upon platforms and bridges in the upper reaches of these forests.",
      "An aeromi tends to carry little to allow mobility, but may utilize belts and clothing that can be fastened between the anchor points of its patagium. Aeromi may utilize humanoid weaponry when needed.",
      "One out of every eight aeromi will be a warrior of 2 Hit Dice (75 XP). A regular aeromi gains a +1 bonus to its Morale if it's led by such a warrior. In aeromi villages, one out of every twelve will be a sub-chief of 4 Hit Dice (240 XP) that does 1d6 points of damage with each claw attack. In lairs of 30 or more, there will be an aeromi chieftain of 6 Hit Dice (500 XP) that does 2d4 points of damage with each claw attack. In the village, aeromi never fail a morale check as long as the chieftain is alive. In addition, there is a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present in any village. A shaman is equivalent to a warrior aeromi statistically, but has Clerical (or Druidic if that optional supplement is utilized by the GM) abilities at level 1d4+1. Each village also has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a witch doctor being present; such an aeromi has the abilities of a Magic-User at level 1d4."

      "An Aghlorv resembles a six-legged, hairless cat with scaly skin and two rows of barbed spines running down its back. Its skin is often a dull amber, and its eyes are generally a deep hazel. Although an aghlorv prefers to crawl on all six legs, it is able to move comfortably on only four (freeing its front paws for attacking) and can move at a reduced rate on its two hind legs, enabling it to attack with the four upper paws. When attacking bipedally, on a successful hit an aghlorv may hold its target with two of its attacking arms; this will give the target the grappled condition and reduce the number of attacks available to the aghlorv to only one claw per round (as long as the hold lasts). Additionally, it is able to climb reasonable terrain easily due to its number of arms and claws.",
      "An aghlorv is highly feared due to its quick speed and ability to move silently. Most commonly, an aghlorv will stalk its prey silently and surprise or else lie in wait, hidden, and spring out to attack at the most opportune time. Because of its lithe and agile nature, it is exceptionally difficult to notice an aghlorv before it is upon you, and even harder to surprise one due to its keen sense of hearing. As such, any creature that encounters an aghlorv has their surprise roll range increased by 2 to all surprise rolls, and any surprise rolls towards the aghlorv has its range reduced by 2 (a minimum of 1)."

Furthermore, so long as the victim of its bite is small or medium in size and weight, the ankheg can drag it backwards, possibly even underground where the victim can be released and allowed to suffocate in the loose dirt.",

Its upper limbs have evolved to resemble humans arms and hands, though its lower limbs are more like those of dinosaur. It can speak Common, its own language, and generally wears robes.",

They evolved along with the other sentient species, though they have little contact with them. Some live in tribes and some in religious communities. They are excellent farmers and herbalists. Many spend their free time as scholars. They preserve their history in writing and in stone carvings. In tribal villages there will always be a shaman with 1d4+1 levels of Clerical abilities. In their religious communities, all members will have 1d4+1 levels of Clerical abilities.",

At the start of combat, all apatosapiens will chant in a long, low tone. Ogre-sized or smaller opponents must make a saving throw vs. Paralysis or be immobilized for 1d6 rounds. This saving throw is only made once: successful PCs are immune to the chant for the remainder of that combat. Apatosapiens may immobilize up to their own number of opponents. They do not kill immobilized opponents, but may strip them of their weapons or restrain them with ropes."

The third form is that of a humanoid which might be any size from halfling to human; other than its dark, coarse hair and slightly bulging eyes, this form is not particularly spider-like. The humanoid form is distinctive; an individual aranea cannot change its humanoid form, either in terms of appearance nor size. An aranea remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one, and can only change forms once per round.",

In these forms it has a movement rate of 30 feet per round. The humanoid form has no other special abilities beyond spells and weapon use. In spider or hybrid form the aranea may bite; those bitten must save vs. Poison or die, in addition to taking normal damage.",

The armorollo is a pack creature and are never found in groups of less than 4. An armorollo moves by rolling across the ground at high speed, springing open at the last moment to attack with its sharp claws. The armorollo can also emit a large cloud of thick white smoke once per day (filling 30 cubic feet) that serves to conceal its movements. Lastly, the armorollo emits a piercing shriek that helps find its prey by following the echo.",
      "Multiple armorollos will work together to attack. Some will stop to emit smoke, others will shriek, and the remainder attack through the smoke guided by the shriek. When fighting as a group, armorollos have a +3 attack bonus."

      "Once the armorphage is on its victims tendrils will slowly pierce the victim; these tendrils themselves will not harm the victim but will allow the creature to slowly feed off its victim, and control the hosts body like a puppet. Each day, the victim must save vs. Death Ray or deduct a level of energy drain, until they reach level 0 and death, when the armorphage will abandon the corpse.",
      "While the armorphage is attached to the body it controls them physically, though their mind is still their own. Their body is completely under the control of the armorphage, which still has access to the victim’s instincts and learned physical skills, allowing the armorphage to attack as if it was the host. Additionally, it can attack with two tendrils that it can extrude from anywhere on its own body.",
      "Attempting to forcefully remove an armorphage will cause it to constrict itself on the victim’s body, causing 2d4 points of damage every round. Attacking the armorphage while it is encasing a victim will split the damage (half to the victim, half to the armorphage, which may constrict its victim as well). Someone who is able to survive having an armorphage removed will recover the energy drain at 1 level per week of rest.",
      "Though they do their very best to avoid it ever happening, if necessary an armorphage without a host can defend itself using the two extruded tentacles it can manifest, though it is more likely to attempt to flee anyone who attacks it in its vulnerable state."

      "In combat, the aurumvorax will typically lay in ambush and pounce on its prey and thus will surprise on a roll of 1-2. Its bite will inflict 1d8 points of damage and will lock into its prey if successful. Thereafter, it will automatically inflict 5 points of damage from the bite and will attack with an additional 2d4 claws, each doing 1d6 points of damage until either it or its prey is dead. Because of its highly dense bones and thick coat, the aurumvorax takes only half damage from blunt weapons.

If both of these attacks hit, it may proceed to the next pair in the same way. If any of the attacks miss the next pair of legs are needed for balance and the attacks stop. The opponent’s size will determine how many pairs of legs can be used for attacks against a single opponent. If the opponent is small one pair of legs can be used, two pair if the opponent is medium (ie man-sized), and at most three pair if the opponent is large sized. If a long bear's attacks are not all against the same opponent, it may not hug, but if both paws in one \"rank\" hit, it may then attack with the next rank, and even a third if both of the second-rank attacks hit.

They mate in the late spring, and the female gives birth to a single cub that will stay with her for a single year before going its own way. During the time she is with a cub, the mother will not mate, and in fact is likely to attack an approaching male to protect her cub.",
      "The migou is a savage and fierce predator, attacking relentlessly; unlike other bears migou are strictly carnivores. They consider humanoids and canines as delicacies, and will go out of their way to hunt them. The hind paws of a migou bear a strange resemblance to bare, humanoid feet, and they can move as quickly on two legs, as they can on all four. The migou's front paws are covered in long shaggy fur, longer than the fur covering the rest of the beast.",
      "Migou have a magical ability which gives them their name of bewitching bear, and making them a vastly more dangerous opponent than a normal bear. Three times a day, the migou can use its phantasmal vision power instead of attacking. The vision creates an effect similar to <strong>hold person</strong> by bewildering and enchanting its victims. All living creatures within a 60-foot radius of the migou must save vs. Paralysis or become bewitched, their mind overwhelmed by the illusions the migou pushes, standing still and staring off into space for one turn. Whenever a paralyzed victim is injured they get a new saving throw. Making the saving throw does not make the victim immune, and another save must be made if the migou uses this power again. All migou are immune to the powers of other migou."

While the bestomper is agitated, a wail emits from its mouth in a 90-degree arc. All creatures with 40 feet must save vs. Magic or fall prone for 1d6 rounds.",
      "The bestomper hovers over the ground by magical levitation. Suddenly, it leaps 20 feet in any direction to bring down the full force of its heel on an unlucky victim. Alternatively, it may tilt forward to apply its mouth to a victim, usually targeting the head of humanoids. 5% of the time when it bites down, it decapitates the victim (on a natural 20). Any successful bite attack heals the bestomper by 1d6 points of damage.",

The toes wriggle about, making them 20% harder to hit (AC 24), but deling 10 points of damage incapacitates the eye, leaving it unable to use its unique energy beam. Eye blasts automatically hit so long as there is line of sight. The victim can only hope to resist the magical effect with a saving throw. Use the following table to randomly determine the type of energy beam for each toe:",

A bog crone is a master potion maker, and its huts and caves are usually festooned with potions of all varieties. As its name suggests, a bog crone prefers to live in swampy, overgrown environs. It is also aquatic and can breathe underwater. It speaks Common and Elvish.",
      "A bog crone uses the terrain of its marshy home to its advantage. It is capable of moving in near-complete silence while in swampy terrain, surprising opponents on 1-4 on 1d6. A favored tactic of a bog crone is to surprise a single opponent and drag them away into a deep pool of water, where it then drowns the individual. A bog crone exudes an aura of unwholesomeness. Near its lair animals grow sick and die, plants wither, and water turns foul. This aura of evil even effects magic; any healing spell cast upon a target that is standing within 30 feet of the crone only heals half the normal amount."

Alternatively, the sphere major has the capability to discharge 2d4 clusters of spheres a round from its nearly featureless head instead of using its windmilling arms, out to a range of 120 feet, inflicting 1d4 points of damage on the targeted enemy per cluster. However, each of these clusters not only subtracts one hit dice from the sphere major, it reduces its HP by 1d8 as well. The sphere clusters expelled by the sphere major reassemble into a brazen sphere recombinant on the round after they are fired."

There is an opening on its head, from which it can fire out streams of spheres quite rapidly, allowing it to attack twice per round, out to a range of 60 feet. The fired spheres will roll back and be reabsorbed by the recombinant the round after they’re fired.

It attacks with its beak for 1d4 points of damage, and flails its wings lined with razor-sharp feathers for 1d6 points of damage. Instead of striking with a wing, a bronze bird may choose to throw a dagger-like feather up to 30 feet, dealing 1d4 points of damage; in flight the range is 90 feet if thrown from above. One can only throw 2 such feather-daggers (one from each wing); the feathers grow back in 1d8 days. A bronze bird is immune to normal fire, receives a +1 bonus to saves against very hot or magical fire, and takes 1 less hit point of damage per die from such attacks.",

However, all caneins share a similar facial structure similar to the various bulldog or boxer type dog breeds, having jowls and squat features.

Most caneins speak Common or the predominate human language of the region; they have no true language of their own.",

Fortunately, its ungainly-balanced neck and general unwillingness to get involved means that it will only be able to bring its head to bear once every 1d4 rounds. However, if it should gain surprise a catoblepas will nearly always forget itself and glance upward long enough to use its gaze.

It tends to start out looking identical to the child it replaces, but as time goes on and the fairy’s magic wears off it becomes increasingly ugly and deformed, sporting long, sharp teeth and hideous, bulging eyes. It goes through puberty as normal, but its height tends to remain stunted throughout its lifetime. Known to have a ravenous appetite, a changeling often eats its surrogate family out of house and home, and is frequently ill-tempered and prone to angry outbursts, in part due to real or perceived persecution. Occasionally, a changeling goes back to live among the fairies when life in human society becomes intolerable, though most forget their origins and live on as ugly humans. Due to its fey lineage, many even become powerful illusionists.",
      "A changeling takes +1 damage from attacks that are metal- or fire-based, and -1 damage from all else. It is abnormally strong for its size, and as such does +1 damage to melee attacks. A changeling also has the ability to magically alter its appearance once per day for a duration of two hours, and often does so as adults in order to make itself taller and more appealing to the opposite sex. A save vs. Spells with a -2 penalty will reveal the changeling's true form. The GM may further add illusionist-type spells to the changeling's repertoire depending on its individual background."

They are born with eyes, but their priests sacrificed their eyes to Camazotz shortly after birth, so almost all cheiropterans encountered will be blind, their empty eye sockets sewn shut. It can still \"see\" through echolocation as a bat does. It is typically armored with a chain mail shirt and wears hard, heavy boots.",
      "80% of a given force will be armed with halberds, and the other 20% with longbows. In addition to the treasure shown, an individual cheiropteran will carry 1d100 triangular bone coins. These are religious tokens, of value only to cheiropterans. It will also carry a strip of chewed rawhide. This is an ancestor-strip, bearing the teeth-marks of the preceding generations, and may be ransomed back to the cheiropteran leaders for as much as 10 gp. Priests will carry a silver holy symbol of Camazotz which is worth 25 gp on the open market, or 100 gp in ransom to the leaders.",

If there are 50 or more, one will be a captain (AC 18, 7 HD,, XP 670). There is a 50% chance that a priest will accompany a party of cheiropterans. A priest is a Level 4-7 (1d4+3) Cleric (AC 16 to 18, (Level)d6 HD, XP in line with level), with full spell-casting powers. If a priest is encountered there will also be 1-3 acolytes of level 1-3 (AC 16, (Level)d6 HD, XP in line with level). Females are only encountered in their lair, and if they must fight they do so as gnolls; there will be females equal to 50% of the number of males. Where females are encountered there will be one whelp for every female. Whelps will typically flee but can fight as goblins if they must.",

A chelonian is protected by thick scaly skin, as well as a shell-like growth that covers their backside except for its thick tail. A chelonian stands about 5 feet tall. However, its neck can stretch out to make it up to 8 feet tall for very short periods.",

      "A chelonian has a vicious bite, causing 1d6 points of damage. It can choose to either attack with a bite or by weapon, but when utilizing a weapon and roll a natural 20 on attack, it can roll for a bite attack as well. If the chelonian finds itself in a grapple (wrestling), the chelonian gets a free bite attack roll each round at +2 to hit. A chelonian is resistant to poisons, and has a +2 bonus on those saves.",
      "A chelonian has a natural swim speed of 30 feet while unencumbered (it cannot swim while wearing armor or encumbered), and it can hold its breath twice as long as the normal rules state. Its underwater vision is also twice as effective as the other races. A chelonian has the ability to submerge with just its eyes and nostrils above the surface of water. When it is able to employ this maneuver, a chelonian can surprise others with a roll of 1-4 on 1d6."

It will typically grab with its claws, then constrict, then pass the victim to its paralytic tentacles. Relying on its chitinous shell for protection, it will use its claws to devastating effect, drawing in two victims each round as it literally mows down opponents, snatching, constricting and leaving them to drop from paralysis or death in its wake to return after the fight and devour them. It favors dragging victims into the water when possible, drowning them via constriction and/or paralysis.",

This is physical damage from the sharp shards of ice, rather than cold damage, so resistance to cold of any sort provides no protection.",

      "The Cynodictis was one of the many species of a group of animals commonly known as \"bear dogs\", which, as the name suggests, had several characteristics of bears and dogs. But they were only related to said animals, not ancestors or transitional forms. A cynodictis was considerably smaller than other bear dogs, only slightly larger than the modern day opossum with a height of about 12 inches.",
      "A cynodictis has great speed and uses this speed to hunt its prey, such as rabbits and small rodents, though it sometimes scavenges. Because of its small size, it fears the larger carnivores in its region. It lives in dens in steep riverbanks that it built itselves, lined with molted fur and vegetation. These dens are also used by cynodictis mothers to raise their pups. These bear dogs give birth to as many as five pups, and are cared for by their mother for several months. A mother cynodictis is brave enough to attack larger animals to protect her young, and should be considered to have a morale of 9."

      "Dancing Monitors are a large variety of lizards that secrete an oil on their skin that facilitates the delivery of poison and venom. When they are agitated, they stand up on their hind legs and whirl and flail about. As they dance, they strike their victims and transfer the oil from their skin, and then they bite their victims to deliver a lethal dose of venom.",
      "Dancing monitors will first make at least one successful touch attack against their victims, which applies a save-targeting penalty on saves vs. Poison. Once a target's fortitude is softened enough, they go in for the kill with a venomous bite which requires a save vs. Poison to avoid instant death. The oil may be cleaned off with soap and water, although this is normally impossible in the middle of combat. Otherwise, the oil will absorb into the victim's skin and remain in effect for 24 hours.",
      "The save-targeting effect causes the named saving throw category to receive a penalty of -1, which is cumulative with any further penalties. The penalty may either be applied to the roll as a -1 or to the target value as a +1. The end result is the same, but a consistent method should be used. The means of reversing the effect, if possible, differs based on the monster that delivers it. Multiple monsters may target the same saving throw category while technically targeting different saves. For example, a monster that targets saves vs. Death and one that targets saves vs. Poison are both targeting the same value; it is up to the GM to decide whether each should be tracked separately once such an effect is applied, as well as what further effects may befall the victims as a result of having the effects combined.",
      "A save-targeting effect will not usually deal damage along with it. The point of a save-targeting effect is to widen the road a GM can take to access and drain the PCs' resources, so \"double-dipping\" should be reserved for especially powerful sources."

      "A dancing shadow looks like a regular shadow at a first glance, however upon contact with a humanoid, it will latch onto the creature, disguising itself as the creature’s shadow almost flawlessly. The only clues that a shadow is hiding a dancing shadow is that it will never flicker, and sometimes it will lay in the incorrect direction based on the available light sources.",
      "Once attached, the dancing shadow will lay dormant for a period of several days before attacking, usually waiting for the most inconvenient moment (when the host is engaged in combat, for example). If the dancing shadow makes a successful attack roll, the victim must make a save vs. Spells. Success on the save will force the shadow to the nearest humanoid, unless it is warded by a circle of salt. If there are no available humanoid victims it will attach itself as a shadow to an inanimate object, ready to ambush another victim later on.",
      "However, if the victim fails the saving roll, the dancing shadow will take control of their body. The victim will still retain their faculties and the ability to speak, but their body will begin to dance uncontrollably. Only now is the shadow vulnerable to attack by magical weapons or spells. It is also at this point the shadow is able to use its claws to attack creatures other than its victim. If the shadow is not defeated, the victim will die of exhaustion after 1d6 (+ Con mod) hours of uncontrollable, exuberant dancing."

Some legends claim that dantaeons carry that infernal heritage in their blood. These stories, along with dantaeon appearance, can make interactions with other races difficult. Many fear them, seeing them as monsters. Some dantaeons reject the ancient stories and try to live peacefully among humans. They can be found in large cities with diverse populations. Others embrace their possible heritage and work as thieves and mercenaries for even the worst villains. They sometimes live near dark ruins, protecting the sites from plunder.",
      "In combat, dantaeons often use a trident to enhance their devilish reputation. They will use their tail as a weapon whenever they are engaged in melee combat. Their skin provides protection against heat, and they take half-damage from fire-based attacks. If the attack permits a saving throw, and it's successful, they take only one-quarter damage. In any group of 6-10 dantaeons, one will be a 3rd-level Magic-user or a 3rd-level Cleric."

After successfully attacking, the darkmantle automatically inflicts 1d4 points of damage each round. While attached to an individual, a darkmantle takes half damage from attacks; the other half is inflicted upon the individual it covers.

      "Highly sought after as pets by those unfamiliar with their true nature, these offspring of the Deceiver are a quarter the size of an adult, growing as they age and gain HD reaching full size after twenty months. They possess a striking greenish-black, catlike appearance with thick serpents growing from their shoulders.",
      "As their <strong><em>deception</em></strong> ability is less refined than that of adults, their actual location varies between 1 and 3 feet from their projected image. This displacement causes a 50% chance of a miss on any first attack. Thereafter, all attacks against the kitten will be at a penalty of -1 to the attack roll. This is not cumulative with the penalty for fighting blind. As a mental power, this ability does not affect mindless creatures, constructs such as golems or living statues, or any sort of undead. Living creatures which are not mindless will be affected even if they do not use sight to target the kitten.",
      "The desire to own these creatures has turned many adventurers into poachers and driven numerous pet enthusiasts to try and capture them on their own.",
      "In the wild, these kittens are always found in their lair and never wandering unless accompanied by a parent. Before the age of six months, when they possess no special abilities, they are never left unguarded.",
      "As they mature, their hit dice (HD) and damage capabilities increase. Younger than six months old they have 1 HD, and their <strong>deception</strong> ability has not yet manifested. Between six and nine months, they have 2 HD, and from this age on they have the limited <strong>deception</strong> ability detailed above. From ten to fifteen months, this increases to 3 HD, and between sixteen and twenty months, they have 4 HD. After twenty months, they reach adulthood and are treated as standard Deceivers.",
      "If any member of the litter is threatened, the kittens will swarm the attacker. Depending on the level of disturbance, the GM may decide whether one or both parents return to the lair to defend their brood.",
      "Should a kitten be successfully abducted, domestication is impossible if it is raised alongside its littermates. However, when hand-reared alone, they may appear tamable. If their food, exercise, and social needs are fully met, there is a 70% chance they will obey their \"owner\" by the age of six months. This obedience does not extend to friends or associates of the owner, though these individuals will not be attacked. The chance of obedience decreases by 5% per month and must be re-rolled monthly, reaching 0% by twenty months. If even one of their three needs is unmet for a month, the chance of obedience decreases by 15% in the following month. If two needs are neglected, or the obedience roll is failed even once, the kitten will go feral.",
      "At the GM's discretion, a happy, well-cared-for kitten may hunt for or protect its owner. Conversely, a feral or uncontrolled kitten may flee, or attack its owner if the opportunity presents itself, depending on how it has been treated."

Its large yellow eyes give it a phenomenal peripheral vision. Its large maw opens on a single row of interlocking teeth. It has a rough leathery skin which often matches the color of the trees it hangs from. Often a parasitic moss will grow on top of its head, which will make it ever harder to spot. It moves among trees by using two or more limbs to support itself. If trapped on the ground, it will use four limbs to walk, but could sit and attack with all its remaining limbs if hard pressed.",
      "It normally attacks by alternating whips and grabs motions from each free limb. The whip attack does 1d4 points of damage. The grab attack only does 1d2 points of damage, but the victim finds themself bound. A bound victim has a chance to free themself each round (1+Strength bonus on 1d8). A limb might be severed with 8 points of damage, which do not count against the creature's hit points.",
      "The decempus will typically focus on a single victim, trying to score two grabs to pull it to its maw the next turn, where it will be subject to 1d10 points of damage. Other bound victims will be dragged or thrown around for an automatic 1d4 points of damage.",
      "If successful in swallowing a prey, the decempus will try to retreat to the top of the trees where it will rest for up to one week.",

As the traits develop the hybrid individual becomes reclusive and of an increasingly alien mindset. The full transformation takes a variable amount time, though not usually completing before the individual becomes middle-aged. When the traits become too obvious to conceal the hybrid departs society to join with the deep ones.",

A delver has spongy flipper-like arms, each of which ends in six black digging nails. A delver's ability to sense vibrations gives the equivalent of Darkvision with a 60-foot range.",
      "A delver produces a mucus-like slime that is highly corrosive. Merely touching it causes 2d6 points of damage to organic creatures. To metallic creatures or objects the slime deals 4d8 points of damage, and rocks, and rock-like creatures (earth elementals for example) the slime causes 8d10 points of damage. A delver prefers to fight from its tunnel, lashing out with its two flippers, causing 1d6 points of damage each (plus the corrosive damage noted above) while the tunnel walls protect its body. On the round following a successful hit, the victim takes 1d6 points of damage from the slime unless is it washed off with at least a quart of fluid. For metal or stone creatures, this damage is half of the noted corrosive damage listed (2d8 or 4d10 respectively). Anyone attacking a delver with natural weapons will take damage from the corrosive slime each time an attack succeeds unless they succeed on a save vs. Paralysis.",
      "Each time a delver strikes, the individual's shield, armor, and clothing (in that order) may be destroyed. The victim must make a save vs. Paralysis for each item; any successful saving throw means subsequent items are unaffected. For example: a Fighter is struck by a delver; they fail their first saving throw, and their shield is destroyed. They succeed at their second save, so their armor and clothing are safe... for this round, at least. Magic shields or armor will lose one \"plus\" each time they are damaged, instead of being destroyed outright."

      "Desert worms, also called sand worms, are giganticl carnivorous worms that live beneath the desert sands. They have gaping mouths full of serrated teeth, but no eyes or other sense organs. They are able to detect vibrations within 120 feet of their location, and will attack anything that moves by bursting up from beneath the sand, gaining surprise on a 1-4 on 1d6. On a natural-20 attack roll, a desert worm will swallow any human-sized or smaller creature it is attacking whole, dealing 1d6 points of damage every round after swallowing them to its prey.",
      "The worm can only swallow one creature at a time. Creatures that have been swallowd can attempt to escape by dealing at least 15 points of damage to the worm with a small blade, such as a dagger from inside the belly of the beast, but it is extremely difficult to-hit under these circumstances, and only a roll of exactly 20 will hit. Desert dwelling peoples live in fear of the desert worms, this fear causing those who know of them to avoid making loud noises or even traveling through the worm's territory at all. Legends say that desert worms guard an ancient treasure, buried deep beneath the sand. Other legends tell of gigantic desert worms big enough to swallow an entire wagon whole, living the the deepest reaches of the desert."

Like all ceratopsians, the armor class of the centrosaurus depends on whether the attacker is in front of the creature, behind, or beside it.",
      "They are aggressive toward interlopers, attacking anyone who might appear to be a threat. These creatures are about 18 feet long and weigh about 12,000 pounds (6 tons). A centrosaur will usually attempt to trample smaller opponents. One adjacent man-sized or up to three smaller opponents may be trampled simultaneously; the creature rolls a single attack roll which is compared to the Armor Class of each potential victim, and then rolls a separate damage roll for each one successfully hit. The gore attack may only be used against a single man-sized or larger creature, but may be used in the same round as the trample if the creature being gored is larger than man-sized. Also note that a charging bonus may be applied to the gore attack."

As they are reptiles, they cannot breathe underwater, though they can hold their breath for an extended period. They are aggressive carnivores, subsisting on fish and small non-aquatic animals, which will be pulled below the surface and drowned. On any successful hit, an elasmosaur has established a hold on the victim, who will then be pulled into and under the water unless they can make a successful save vs. Death Ray to break free. An elasmosaur is not strong enough to thus move any creature weighing more than 300 pounds."

A pentaceratops will usually attempt to trample smaller opponents. Two adjacent man-sized or up to three smaller opponents may be trampled simultaneously; it rolls a single attack roll which is compared to the Armor Class of each of the potential victims, and then rolls a separate damage roll for each one successfully hit. The gore attack may only be used against a single man-sized or larger creature, but may be used in the same round as the trample if the creature being gored is larger than man sized.

      "A Styracosaurus is a ceratopsian dinosaur, a member of the family best known for the triceratops. While the triceratops has three horns, the styracosaur has a single large horn on its nose and a frill of at least four horns; these latter horns are defensive and not normally used to attack. Like all ceratopsians, the armor class of the styracosaurus depends on whether the attacker is in front of the creature, behind, or beside it.",
      "They are aggressive toward interlopers, attacking anyone who might appear to be a threat. These creatures are about 25 feet long and weigh about 20,000 pounds (10 tons). A styracosaur will usually attempt to trample smaller opponents. Up to two adjacent man-sized or up to four smaller opponents may be trampled simultaneously; it rolls a single attack roll which is compared to the Armor Class of each of the potential victims, and then rolls a separate damage roll for each one successfully hit. The gore attack may only be used against a single man-sized or larger creature, but may be used in the same round as the trample if the creature being gored is larger than man-sized. Also note that a charging bonus may be applied to the gore attack."

Only rarely venturing to the surface, their long, sinuous bodies, are well adapted to navigating the narrow tunnels and confined spaces of their subterranean domain. And though they are the slowest fliers among dragons, the exceptional aerial agility developed from having to maneuver through restrictive airspaces filled with obstacles like stalactites and stone columns, makes them perfectly suited to flight in their native domain.",
      "Cave dragon hatchlings have deep purple scales so dark they are almost black, which lighten through violet to indigo as the creature ages, from which they draw their alternate name of purple dragons.",
      "To compensate for their relatively poor eyesight (compared to other dragons,) cave dragons possess an advanced form of echolocation similar to that of bats. This ability allows them to \"see\" in total darkness, functioning equivalently to darkvision out to 240 feet and even detecting invisible creatures within that range. This echolocation is a lower powered modulation of the cave dragons powerful sonic breath weapon.",
      "Solitary and territorial by nature, cave dragons dwell in the deepest caverns, where they hoard their treasures. As patient hunters, they prefer to ambush their prey in the twisting tunnels surrounding their lairs. Their sonic breath weapon can shatter rock and cause cave-ins, making it particularly dangerous in their underground environment.",
      "The cave dragons breath weapon emits a wave of destructive sonic resonance that damages and disorients opponents in a cone. In addition to its usual damage, the cave dragon's sonic breath weapon has a stunning effect. Those caught in the cone must make an additional save vs. Paralysis or be stunned for one round. When directed at unstable sections of cavern walls or ceilings, the breath weapon's resonance can trigger rockfalls in vulnerable areas, the areas susceptible, as well as the results should be determined by the Game Master.",

A dragonne's wings are useful only for short flights, carrying the creature for 10 to 20 minutes at a time at relatively slow speeds.",
      "A dragonne attacks by biting and clawing. In addition, every 1d4 rounds a dragonne can produce a tremendous roar. To anyone within 120 feet, the roar causes temporary weakness, resulting in a -2 penalty to attack rolls, damage, and any Strength checks for 2d6 rounds unless they save vs. Paralysis. Those within 30 feet are also deafened for the same period, with no save allowed. A deafened creature can react only to what it can see or feel, is surprised on 1-3 on 1d6, and suffers a -1 penalty to its initiative rolls. However, a deafened creature is immune to further roars until its deafness alleviates (after the 2d6 rounds)."

The maximum penalty (or bonus) which may accrue is -6 (or +6).",

The only surefire way to detect the presence of a drat is by noticing the ever-increasing string of unlikely events beginning to happen.

Duckbears stand about 9 feet tall and weigh up to 1,600 pounds, regardless of sex. Duckbears are not especially bright, in fact their intelligence more closely matches that of a pigeon than that of a bear. If they feel threatened by an intruder encroaching on their lair, or if the duckbear is attacked, it will fight back with great ferocity, but there are no records of a duckbear attacking unprovoked."

      "Ear worms are tiny insect larvae found in old wood. In order to mature into their adult insect form (a kind of large fly, according to sages), they must eat meat, burrowing through it as they do through wood. They are particularly attracted to the various orifices of animals and humanoids; they are not specifically fond of ears, but were so named because of their propensity for traveling from decrepit dungeon doors into the ears of adventurers listening at them.",
      "If any living creature makes prolonged contact with an infested wooden object or structure (at least one combat round), up to 1d8+8 of them will enter the creature, preferably via an orifice, but if necessary they will puncture the skin. They secrete a numbing agent that prevents the victim from feeling their presence. The larvae will eat away at the victim slowly, but as they move inward they will cause 1 point of damage every hour for each larva. The larva mature in 4d6 hours, at which point they move to the skin surface en-masse, doing an additional 1 point of damage each before emerging in their final form and flying off to mate and then find some rotten wood in which to lay their eggs.",
      "While the victim does not generally feel the larvae entering their body, there may be other side effects that might tend to reveal the infestation. Those making entry through exposed skin, for example, will leave a scattering of tiny holes dotted with blood. Individuals who were infested by way of the ear sometimes report hearing distant music, chanting, or singing, never clear enough to be understood; this effect generally lasts until the larvae undergo their final transformation and leave the victim's body (or are killed somehow, as described below).",
      "There are several possible ways to cure a character or creature infested with ear worms. First, and easiest, is to <strong>cure disease</strong>, which will instantly kill all larvae infesting a creature. Drinking a poison potion is another method; whoever drinks the poison must, of course, save vs. Poison or die, but so must the larvae. Area-effect spells (such as <strong>fireball</strong>) do full damage to the victim but only half damage to the larvae; consider the entire group of larvae as a unit, where each point of damage kills one of them, and any remaining thereafter continue to damage the victim. The referee may choose to allow other methods of killing the larvae; players are counseled to be creative."

Adults are about 6 feet in length and weigh about 450 pounds each. They are found in fresh water in warm climates. Once per turn an electric eel can create a burst of electricity which expands like a <strong>fireball</strong> in the water, causing damage based on the distance between the eel and each victim. Those within 5 feet suffer 3d8 points of damage; those within 10 feet, 2d8 points of damage; within 15 feet, 1d8 points of damage. A successful saving throw vs. Death Ray reduces damage by half, but those failing the saving throw are also stunned (unable to move) for 2d4 rounds. Creatures beyond 15 feet may feel the electricity but will not be damaged by it. Electric eels are not themselves affected by electrical attacks.",

An individual weed eel is around 5 feet long and weighs about 300 pounds. Weed eels surprise on 1-5 on 1d6 due to their camouflage, and will lie in wait for potential victims to move close enough to attack. The bite of a weed eel will kill any living creature that fails a save vs. Poison. Colonies of weed eels live in chaotic networks of tunnels with multiple \"holes\" or entrances arranged in clusters, and by extending themselves from these holes they complete the illusion of being just a patch of weeds.",

The shock causes 1d4 points of damage for each hit die of the giant eel; a save vs. Dragon Breath is allowed for half damage. During a round when a giant electric eel uses its shock, it is immune to electrical attacks. On other rounds it has a +2 bonus on saves against electrical attacks."

An elchman sheds its antlers each year, so there are periods when its antlers are too small to attack with. While each is completely furred, an elchman will wear additional hides or furs from creatures such as bears or wolves, but never from herbivores. An elchman is essentially immune to cold environmental effects and even extreme or magical cold causes only half-damage. If a save is involved with such a cold-based effect, it receives a +4 bonus."

      "An elemental is a being formed from one of the foundational elements of reality. In Western traditions, the classical elements are air, earth, fire, and water; Asian traditions include a different group: fire, earth, metal, water, and wood. This book presents the full range needed for either tradition, and to those types are added cold and lightning elementals for those who wish to be less traditional. As always, the Game Master decides what sort of monsters appear in their world, and so not all of the following creatures may be encountered.",

      "The summoner of an elemental must concentrate on it to control it, and may take no other action, including attacking, being attacked, or moving, or control will be lost. Once control is lost it cannot be regained, and the uncontrolled elemental will move directly toward the summoner and attack.",
      "Elementals must be summoned from a large quantity of the appropriate natural material. For example, air elementals require a large quantity of air (so small underground spaces will not support the summoning of one); earth elementals require access to natural earth or stone (and worked stone such as the stone walls of a castle will not work); fire elementals require a large fire such as a bonfire; and water elementals require access to a substantial body of water, at the very least a river or lake (small streams and artificial pools will not work). Finally, when an elemental is summoned, no other elemental of the same type may be summoned in the same day within a radius of 100 miles of the location.",
      "Non-magical weapons cannot harm an elemental. Attacks made by an elemental should be considered magical for purposes of determining how much damage creatures resistant to the elemental's attack form should suffer.",

      "A blood elemental is vaguely humanoid in shape, looking as if its body was made out of a giant blood clot. A strong smell of iron, like blood sausage or raw liver, emanates from it. Its body is entirely made out of blood, stands about 8 feet tall, and weighs around 500 pounds.",
      "A blood elemental can engulf the freshly-killed body of a (formerly) living creature and heal; for each hit die the creature possessed when it was alive, the blood elemental will heal 2 hit points. This action takes a full round for the blood elemental to complete. For example, a blood elemental that engulfs the body of what once was a 10 HD creature will heal up to 20 hit points by the beginning of the next round. Moreover, so long as the elemental is in contact with a source of blood it will steadily heal 1 hit point per turn, doing so as long as the elemental can draw from the source."

Their semi-liquid form permits them to form their extremities into wickedly sharp blades, which is their preferred means of attack. Those wearing metal armor receive no protection against a metal elemental (except for magical bonuses, if any); indeed, on a successful hit one deals an additional 1d8 points of damage to creatures, vehicles, or structures that are made of or in direct contact with some form of metal. Lightning attacks deal double damage to a metal elemental. Like an earth elemental, a metal elemental cannot cross a body of water greater than its own height."

      "Whenever is has stored enough energy, instead of a stalk, it produces a five-foot tall blood-red flower which smells like a rotting corpse. A trumpet-like appendage grows in the middle of the flower. The fragrance of the infectious mind attracts carrion eaters such as ants, beetles, and other animals. Whenever a large prey comes in contact with the flower, the appendage shoots a cloud of spores at it, point blank. A save vs. Dragon Breath must be made to avoid the spores, otherwise the victim suffers hallucinations for 1d4 turns, falls comatose thereafter, and rises as an infected under the control of the infectious mind after 1d6+8 hours.",
      "The infectious mind has no intellect or ego of its own, but it is able to form a collective identity though its infected spawns. The telepathic link between the infected and the encephallos titanum can span up to twenty miles.",
      "The hit points given are for the plants and flower, but their destruction will not kill the corm, which must be unearthed and burned.",
      "Once it has bloomed, the infectious mind also produces 1d4 new tubers which it will want its infected spawns to bury under piles of corpses at the extremities of its telepathic range. These will become active in the next century."

They prefer peaceful forests but are as curious as cats and as unpredictable as pixies, and thus might be found anywhere.",

While they can inflict a painful bite, their preferred attack is their breath weapon, an invisible cloud of gas 2 feet in diameter that causes any living creature in the area of effect to become euphoric unless a save vs. Dragon Breath is made. Euphoria lasts 1d4 turns, and while affected the creature wanders around aimlessly in a daze, unable to attack, cast spells, and suffering a -2 penalty to its armor class.",

Its head is cat-like but with bat-like ears. A flederkatze can fold its wings close to its body, appearing to be a normal cat unless closely inspected. A flederkatze has exceptional hearing, including a form of echolocation with a 120-foot range; normal invisibility is easily detected, but magical silence effectively negates this power. Its actual eyesight is quite poor (roughly 30 feet), and it suffers discomfort in bright sunlight (-1 attack penalty in bright or magical light).",
      "A flederkatze attacks with its claws and bite like other felines. Its bite contains a toxin that causes 1 additional point of damage each round for 10 rounds as the poison travels through the body. Each round the affected can roll a save vs. Poison to halt any further damage, although subsequent bites will produce the wounding effect anew (resetting the 10-round duration). Only one such point of poison damage is applied each round, even if multiple bites are scored without successfully saving. In addition to physical attacks, a flederkatze can <strong>detect magic</strong> at will, become invisible at will, and once per day can <strong>bestow curse</strong> (reverse of <strong>remove curse</strong>) as a 7th-level Magic-user (usually utilizing the \"-4 to attack rolls and saves\" version).",
      "Silver or magical weapons are required to strike a flederkatze. So long as it has at least 1 HP remaining, the creature regenerates 1 HP each round. It saves against magic (including wands) with a +4 bonus."

A fyrenewt has the general appearance of a man-sized humanoid amphibian of the salamander sort. Rather than slick or slimy, a fyrenewt's skin is rather rough and sandy in texture and has hues of crimson-tinted browns. Fyrenewts speak their own language.",
      "The typical fyrenewt warrior wears chainmail armor and wields a metal weapon such as a sword or metal-shafted lance. In addition to a weapon attack, the fyrenewt can breathe forth a spray (cone-shaped) of fluid that instantly ignites upon contact with air. This breath weapon is usable no more than once every ten rounds, and causes 2d4 points of damage (or half if a save vs. Dragon Breath succeeds) to any creatures within 10 feet in front of the fyrenewt.",
      "A fyrenewt is immune to non-magical fire attacks, and even against magical fire it takes only half damage, and saves are made at +4. Conversely, cold-based attacks against a fyrenewt causes double damage and the fyrenewt has an additional -2 penalty on any appropriate saves.",
      "Fyrenewts have stronger leaders that wear plate mail (AC 18) and have 4+4 hit dice (280 XP). This leader's breath weapon causes 4d4 points of damage (1d4 per HD). There may be even stronger chieftains or kings. About 1d4 fyrenewts may also be a priest with Clerical levels equivalent to one's HD. They prefer spells involving heat, flame, or fire. If the GM utilizes the optional Druid supplement, then the fyrenewt may choose fire-oriented spells from the Druid spell list. Even traditional spells are often cast in such a way as to include fire, smoke, heat or the like in ways that are cosmetic only. For instance, a <strong>protection from evil</strong> spell might appear to line the fyrenewt in a flame-like aura."

This in turn has led them to being the most feared of all the geminate serpents.",

      "Uniquely, bone geminate serpents have no breath weapon, rather they have an innate magical ability that they may use up to their hit dice times per day, though they can only use it at most every other round. This ability turns the serpent’s bones into razor-sharp steel blades, giving it bonuses to its armor class and attack bonus as listed in the table below, and also a +3 damage bonus on its constriction attack. ",
      "While this ability is active, the constriction attack also counts as a magical weapon. Once every day a bone geminate serpent can cast <strong>raise dead</strong> on all creatures within a 30-foot radius of its body, the spell lasting for as many rounds as the serpent has hit dice, before the raised creatures once more fall dead. This is how bone geminate serpents train their offspring to fight. As bone geminate serpents constrict with sharp exposed bones, and have no need for live prey, their constriction attacks do real damage rather than subduing.",

White serpents lay in wait, burying themselves in snow and then leaping forth, surprising on 1-4 on 1d6. Their lairs are usually underground burrows lined by webs to help ensnare any unwary interlopers. White geminate serpents use their breath weapon to ensnare their surprised prey, then dragging them back to their lair wrapped in the serpent’s web. The serpent's web does not disappear like the<strong> </strong><strong>web </strong>spell, but will remain for years; however, just like the spell the web of a white geminate serpent is highly flammable.",

It is this form that gives the above statistics when pressed for a fight, although a gerbalaine is more likely to run away than fight. When in its natural mouse-size form, a gerbalaine has effectively only 1 HP, but is very difficult to hit (AC 22). A gerbalaine who saves (with halfling bonuses) against an area-of-effect damaging spell takes no damage, and even if the save fails takes only half damage.

    "description_paragraphs": [
      "Ghost Shrooms appear as a patch of black mushrooms growing underground. A conical cap sits upon a main stalk from which mycelia extend to smaller stalks, which might be as far as 20 feet from the main stalk. The largest stalk stands three feet tall.",
      "This fungus is strange, seemingly a natural living group of mushrooms but behaving and being detected as a form of undead. Indeed, ghost shrooms can subsist only on dead flesh, which they collect by entangling and constricting living beings until unconscious and then infiltrating them with strands of mycelia (the fungal equivalent of plant roots).",
      "The ghost shroom remains motionless until it suddenly attacks, thus surprising on a roll of 1-3 on 1d6. A successful attack effectively entangles the victim in a sticky goo. Every round thereafter, the stem presses downward, doing an additional 1d4 points of damage. A victim may attempt to escape with a save vs. Death Ray (with Strength bonus added).",
      "When the air around the Ghost Shroom is disturbed by living creatures, spores are released in the air that produce a sickly-sweet and dank aroma which attracts lesser undead such as skeletons (1d8 individuals) and zombies (1d6-1 individuals). These monsters are compelled to seek to grapple nearby living creatures and drag or push them into the ghost shroom clumps.",
      "Though a group of ghost shrooms is technically a single entity, the main stalk and each subordinate stalk are given their own hit dice and hit points. Destroying a small stalk does not affect the rest of the patch, but destroying the main stalk results in the smaller stalks ceasing to attack for 1d4 rounds. Entangled creatures are still held but the per-round damage is not applied for this duration. Then, one of the remaining stalks becomes the main stalk (though its statistics do not change right away) and the patch resumes hostilities. If the ghost shroom patch survives such a confrontation, the new main stalk will gain 1 hit die per week until it reaches 4 hit dice. New small stalks can be spawned at a rate of one per month any time the main stalk has its full 4 hit dice.",
      "A ghost shroom is vulnerable to many things that affect undead, including a <strong>scroll of protection from undead</strong> for example. They can be Turned by a Cleric, with the following special effects: The main stalk is a 4 hit die creature, and the smaller stalks are 2 hit dice each. A smaller clump is outright destroyed by a successful Turn, while the main stem, if successfully Turned (but not destroyed), becomes dormant for at least 2d4 hours. As usual, apply Turning affects to the lowest hit dice first."

Unlike trolls however, gnolls will die when their hit points reach zero. Moreover, wounds caused by fire and acid cannot be regenerated and require normal healing. When confronted with attackers wielding fire or acid, regenerating gnolls exhibit a lower morale (6) due to their heightened vulnerability.",

Additionally, there is a 1-2 in 1d6 chance of a shaman being present in the lair, as well as a 1 in 1d6 chance of a witch or warlock.

Some bands include Trappers, who generally keep themselves separate from the normal warriors; they set traps and scout for the captains. Trappers are highly skilled, and can set tripwire-activated nets, hidden spikes, and other devious traps remarkably quickly to hinder those in the path of the main troop. Trappers are less robust than the tribes warriors having 1 HD (23 XP) and wear lighter leather armor (AC 14) but move faster (40') and favor short bows, occasionally using poison arrows (save v. Poison or be paralyzed for 1d6 turns). Trappers however still save as 2nd-level Fighters.",

Moon Goblin Champions are 5 HD (360XP), wear platemail, and carry a shield (AC 20), preferring swords or maces as weapons. Champions are highly skilled warriors, but bind themselves strictly to a misunderstood code of honor or chivalry that they do not fully understand, often challenging foes to single combat. Shamans are the moon goblins spiritual guides. They have 3 HD (175 XP), wear ornate mail hauberks (AC 16) decorated with bones and festooned with still bloody trophies, fighting with the same swords or maces that champions prefer. They are however very capable magically, being able to cast spells as if they were Clerics of 6th level.",

They have completed the quest of journeying high into the mountains and attempting to tame a wyvern (as per the <strong>Basic Fantasy </strong><strong>RPG</strong><strong> Core Rules</strong>). The ones that succeed are the most powerful, and sturdiest of their kind, having 8 HD (875 XP), wear enchanted platemail and shield (AC 22), fighting with sword or mace, and long spears that they can use from the backs of their fearsome flying steeds. Moon goblins with a wyvern rider amongst their numbers gain a +2 to their morale checks.",

The shaman-kings can be formidable opponents to even the most powerful of opponents. Shaman-kings have 12 HD (1,975 XP), wear ornate enchanted platemail decorated with bones and bloody trophies (AC 22), and shields, and fight with either a sword or mace like their lesser shaman brothers. Shaman kings can cast spells as if they were 12th-level Clerics. They are never found unless leading bands of at least 200 moon goblins, and will always be accompanied by an honor guard of 1d4+1 moon goblin champions.

      "A mystical tree-like fey, the Golden Oak, or Fey Oak, is a dark malevolent creature that appears to be a gigantic, ancient gnarled oak tree, its branches covered with metallic, golden leaves. One oddity is that its branches also hold a weirdly-mixed selection of fruits and exotic flowers, all at once, and all year around.",
      "Golden oaks are surrounded by many butterflies with mirror-like highly-reflective wings that flitter around the tree, swarming around any insects or small animals that approach the golden oak too closely, or around larger creatures the golden oak engages in combat, blinding them for 1d6 turns with the reflections of their wings unless a save vs. Petrify is made. Then the swarm will attack the blinded creatures by preference, each butterfly latching on with a set of tiny but razor-sharp teeth, the entire swarm doing 3d6 damage per round, not stopping until they have stripped their victim to nothing more than bare bones. Though it seems they are separate creatures, and the golden oak may promote this idea, the butterflies are actually part of the oak itself and completely under its control. It draws nourishment from whatever they devour as its primary means of feeding.",
      "Naturally wicked and cruel, the golden oak is extremely intelligent, cunning, and devious. With typical cruelty of the darker fey, it revels in tricking mortals into eating its fruit and harvesting its flowers, also distributing knowledge, forbidden and dark in such a way as to always bring pain and death to the knowledge seekers. The golden oak speaks all languages, though it has no obvious mouth, its voice sounding like the wind through its branches. Golden oaks also have the ability to teach Magic-users spells, though will only do so for a very steep price.",
      "Examples of the fruit and flowers that can be found among the golden oak's branches, the \"gifts\" it provides to its victims include:",
      "A flower resembling the flower of a pitcher plant in brilliant shades of violet and blue, contains magical ink that allows its user to inscribe a spell of any level with no coins needed for materials. Another flower heals wounds; when it is brewed into a tea it functions as if a <strong>heal</strong> spell had been cast. Yet another flower acts as a highly potent panacea when used in a poultice, acting as if both <strong>cure disease</strong> and <strong>neutralize poison</strong> spells have been cast. Fruit that can be found on the branches includes some that look like the most delicious, perfect, juicy rosy red apple. However, biting into it will cause near-instant death, and a month later, the victim will rise from the grave as a vampire. Another fruit, looking like a pear, contains 1d6 seeds, shaped like miniature dragon’s teeth. When planted in the ground they grow into skeletons overnight, and will be obedient to the planter’s commands.",
      "Every gift received from the golden oak comes with an attached curse; anyone learning magic from, or using one of the oak's fruits or flowers will be subject to a curse as per the spell.",
      "Golden oaks are powerful Magic-users in their own right, being able to cast spells up to 6th level as if they were a 12th-level Magic-user."

It can be found anywhere there are undead monsters having 4 or fewer hit dice, especially in cemeteries and tombs, and one grave dancer will be accompanied by at least 6 such creatures. When encountered, the grave dancer and its attendant undead will be dancing to strange dismal music which seems to have no source.",
      "All undead monsters within 60 feet of the grave dancer will dance, receiving a +3 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws. Living creatures within the same 60-foot radius of the grave dancer suffer a penalty of -2 to attack rolls and saving throws, and a penalty of -1 to morale. Creatures which cannot hear the music will be unaffected.",
      "As with all undead monsters, a grave dancer is immune to <strong>sleep</strong>, <strong>charm</strong>, and <strong>hold</strong> magic, as well as any spell affecting the mind. A grave dancer can only be hit by magical weapons, but when hit the grave dancer suffers no damage; instead it disappears (along with the accompanying music) for 1d6 rounds. Only successfully Turning one (as a vampire) or eliminating all other undead within the area will vanquish a grave dancer."

An adult male stands on average 6 foot 5 inches tall and weighs around 260 pounds; females are slightly smaller than males. A grawl typically goes about naked but sometimes paints itself to better blend into the darkness of its tunnel homes. It constantly prowls its territory and will attack any creature that strays into the area. Most grawls do not carry weapons and fight only with their teeth and claws. The remainder carry stone clubs and axes and occasionally can be found carrying higher-quality weapons taken from prior victims.",
      "A grawl has Darkvision to a range of 120 feet. It suffers a ‑2 attack penalty in bright sunlight or within the radius of a<strong> light </strong>spell. A grawl can speak a pidgin of Orc, Goblin, Dwarf, and Common, although its speech sounds like animal growls to most humanoids.",
      "Grawls are vicious and wild in battle, showing little discipline or forethought. A tool-using grawl is more likely to use rudimentary tactics, like feigned retreats into waiting ambushes. If a grawl is reduced to 25% or less of its original hit points, it enters a berserk fury and gains a +2 bonus to its attack and damage rolls, but suffers a -2 penalty to its armor class. This rage lasts until the grawl is dead or all enemies are dead or out of sight.",

Then from some of its many eyes, it unleashes a formidable barrage of eye rays upon its foes. Each round, it fires 1d4 rays, each targeting a different adversary. If the roll exceeds the number of available targets, any additional rays are lost. The GM has the option to randomly determine the rays or strategically select those with the most devastating effects.",

When their usefulness ends, the great orb of eyes has no hesitation in draining these slaves for sustenance."

Hawksian griffons are slightly larger than regular griffons, being approximately 12 feet from nose to tail, and standing roughly 7 feet at the shoulder. They have a wide variety of colors, tending towards unnatural colors for their component beasts; dark gray and red are the most common colors, with a multicolored \"belt\" of fur and feathers marking the point where the lion and eagle bodies meet. Female hawksian griffons are slightly larger and more aggressive than the males of the species. They prefer savannas or other grasslands for their range, and are not fussy eaters, preying on pretty much any creature that is unfortunate enough to cross their path. They are mostly solitary; when more than one is encountered it will be a mated pair.",

Beak to tail, imperial griffons can reach up to 15 feet in length. A truly majestic and fearsome creature, depending on its habitat it can be colored anything from orange, light brown, or pure snow white, with a tiger’s distinctive black stripes. Its massive wings can span 40 feet or more, and a mature specimen weighs around 900 pounds.",
      "They usually choose to nest in caves or cliff faces in the mountains, in either cold or very hot and humid climates. To an imperial griffon, anything smaller than itself is prey, and they will swoop down from out of the sun to attack. Like the more common griffon, they are especially fond of horse flesh, favoring them above all other prey. While mated pairs may stay together while raising their young for awhile, they are otherwise solitary animals, exclusively preferring to live and hunt alone.",

An individual grimfrog looks like an ordinary small green frog, at least until it opens its mouth and shows off its fearsome array of interlocking flesh-shearing teeth. However, the real danger of grimfrogs is that they attack in swarms. Because of their small size and innocuous appearance, grimfrogs surprise on 1-3 on 1d6 even if they have been noticed by their potential victims (unless such victims are already familiar with grimfrogs).",
      "An ordinary swarm of grimfrogs consists of one individual per hit point. They attack by jumping onto a victim and biting any accessible flesh. If a grimfrog swarm scores a hit, it does 1 point of damage plus 1 additional point for each point the attack roll exceeds the victim's armor class (but never more than the number of surviving grimfrogs in the swarm).",
      "A swarm may split into two or more swarms of roughly-equal numbers, dividing the swarm's hit dice between them; no smaller swarm will be formed that has less than 10 hit points, so for example a swarm having 20 hit points can divide into no more than two smaller swarms. A swarm will usually split in this way if there are several potential victims close together.",
      "Since attacking grimfrogs literally climb around on the bodies of their victims, any attack against a swarm which has engaged a victim will also hit the victim if the attack roll is higher than the victim's armor class. Grimfrogs are soft and squishy, and gain their relatively high armor class from their small size and quick movements; a <strong>slow</strong> spell will reduce the armor class of the swarm to 11.",

A grimlock is susceptible to sound- and scent-based attacks however, and is affected normally by loud noises, sonic spells (such as <strong>silence 15' radius</strong>), and overpowering odors. Negating a grimlock's sense of smell or hearing reduces its ability to fight. If both of these senses are negated, a grimlock is effectively blinded.

Only a hiveling's pale, evilly-grinning face is exposed. All hivelings in a group are indistinguishable, and they do not have any obvious gender; how they reproduce is a mystery. Most importantly, a group (clan or tribe) of hivelings are connected together magically into a hive-mind. This gives them a morale equal to 2 plus the number of surviving hivelings in the group (maximum 12).",
      "The connection between them is so powerful that they actually share hit points. All hivelings of the same clan or tribe within a 120-foot radius \"contribute\" their hit points to a pool, and any damage inflicted is deducted from the pool. So long as the total hit points in this pool are greater than the number of individuals, none of them will fall; however, when the remaining hit points are less than the number of hiveling individuals, they will begin to fall, starting with the last one hit and spreading to those nearby.",
      "A hiveling has a +4 bonus for high Dexterity, which accounts for their armor class and also applies to all attacks with ranged weapons. When rolling for initiative, roll once for the entire group and add this bonus to the roll.",
      "Due to their slight stature, hivelings can only use small weapons such as short swords, daggers, slings, etc., but they can attack freely with two melee weapons at no penalty. They also have the ability to pick pockets with a 65% chance of success.",
      "A hiveling can detect the presence of magic items in a 30-foot radius, and can identify any magic item within 10 feet. They are not particularly smart, and will avoid items that are complex or have multiple abilities. Hivelings do not speak (though they do gibber madly when they attack, there is no meaning to it), and thus will avoid items related to speaking languages. Neither do they read or write, so they will not be interested in scrolls or spell books.",
      "On the other hand, a hiveling can activate any magic item usable by a Magic-user (including, of course, those usable by any class); even one that requires command words can be used, without need to actually speak the words. A hiveling is entirely capable of using a <strong>wand of fireballs</strong>, for example.",
      "Any time a hiveling detects an \"interesting\" magic item, all other hivelings in its group will act intelligently to try to acquire the item. If the hivelings are badly injured, they may seek out any character carrying a <strong>potion of </strong><strong>healing</strong> and attempt to steal it or slay the one carrying it, so they can use it themselves.",
      "Even if a group of hivelings has Morale of 12, they may choose to abandon combat when they believe they have acquired all the interesting items held by their enemies."

Likewise, a hob takes pride in its work and is often found in civilized homes helping with chores. The only payment it will accept is a bowl of porridge with a slab of butter on it. This pride also carries into the hob's personal life, though, and if it is offended, it will become a great nuisance until one makes amends with them.",

In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a Cleric being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a clan chief is present).

A homunculus never travels beyond this range willingly, though it can be moved forcibly. If this occurs, the creature does everything in its power to regain contact with its master. An attack that destroys a homunculus deals 2d10 points of damage to its master.",

It has a long, thick tapered tail. The male also has a lion mane and is up to 25% larger (and has 15 HD), and can weigh in excess of a thousand pounds.",

It will simultaneously rake with 2d4 of its claws, each inflicting another 2d6 points of damage, until either it or its prey is dead. Against smaller opponents such as humanoids, the ichneumon will only be able to attack with one bite and its front 2 claws each round.",
      "Because of its magical fur, the ichneumon takes half damage from slashing weapons, including the claws of other creatures. It is naturally immune to all poison of any kind, including gas. Its coat also gives it protection from cold, and it only takes half damage from magical cold including breath weapons. When on the prowl, the ichneumon will coat itself with several layers of mud that hardens. In this state, it is immune to normal fire and it will only take half damage from magical fire, lighting, or acid, including breath weapons.",

A female will usually nest in the lair of a defeated dragon along with a kit of up to HD6 and the dragon's hoard. Males, in contrast, lair in small isolated dens with no treasure."

The earthquake caused by an agares is limited to a diameter of 240 feet and the tremors are centered on the agares. The intensity of the tremors can be high enough to uproot a large tree or cave the roof of a cave, but as the creature loves stonework, it will be loathe to use it to damage stone buildings and fortifications, choosing instead to use it for show or to trigger traps such as an unstable pillar of stones or a dangerous object loosely held by a statue."

They have the ability to shapeshift into an ugly old man in order to lead their victims into traps, whom they will ultimately kill and devour once they are finished toying with them. The baubas may indeed wait a long while before finally eating their victim, as terror makes the meat taste sweeter.",
      "A baubas feeds on the fear of its victim. When encountered in its natural form, all opponents must make a morale check each round. For every person who fails, their morale is semi-permanently lowered by 1, and the baubas heals 1d6 HP. Only a <strong>restoration</strong> spell will return their morale to normal.",
      "In combat, the baubas may attack with its claws, attempting to grab hold of people. Once they are held, it may bite them or drag them away to murder them in private, usually in some manner that is cruel and unusual.",
      "Baubas have a number of magic powers as well. They may cast <strong>darkness</strong>, <strong>phantasmal force</strong>, and <strong>invisibility</strong> each once per day, and have a 90% chance of being able to hide in the dark.",
      "As they are otherworldly creatures, a baubas cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons."

Strength damage can kill a victim if the Strength score is reduced to less than 1.

      "A Fiend is a large masculine humanoid devil with bat-like wings; an average individual will be 12 feet tall and weigh 800 pounds. They often wrap their wings tightly around themselves like a cloak and appear wreathed in flames. They are generally armed with a weapon which resembles a mace with a hook in one hand and a club with jagged teeth in the other, and a fiend can attack with both weapons each round with no penalty on the attack roll. Fiends all effectively have maximum human Strength, though they do not add attack or damage bonuses for this.",
      "These monsters are hard to kill due to the fact that they regenerate at a rate of 2 hit points per round; damage inflicted by holy water (and possibly other holy items as determined by the GM) cannot be regenerated. Unlike a troll, a fiend will not continue to regenerate if reduced to zero or fewer hit points, but can in fact be slain in the normal way. As with most infernals, a fiend can only be damaged by magical weapons.",
      "Instead of making a normal attack, a fiend can choose to use its whip-like tail, which does 2d4 points of damage on a successful hit and holds fast the victim, if man-sized or smaller, inflicting an additional 2d4 points of damage each round. Worse, once a fiend has captured a victim in this way, it may then act as it wishes in subsequent rounds while maintaining the hold and doing the additional damage automatically; the only limitation is that the fiend is reduced to half movement. Such a trapped victim generally cannot attack, but may break free by rolling to open doors with 1d20 instead of the usual 1d6 die roll.",
      "Fiends radiate a powerful fear effect which functions as the spell <strong>cause fear</strong> affecting all in a 30-foot radius, with a saving throw vs. Spells allowed to resist. Anyone who successfully saves cannot be affected by that fiend's fear aura again for 24 hours. Other infernals are not affected by this power.",
      "Fiends have several spell-like abilities that can be used once per round instead of performing a normal attack: <strong>wall of fire</strong>, <strong>detect invisible</strong>, <strong>dispel magic</strong>, <strong>polymorph self</strong>, and <strong>hold person</strong>.",
      "Once per day a fiend may also attempt to summon 1d4 barbed devils (page 145) with a 70% chance of success, and once per day may attempt to summon another fiend (55% chance of success). If either summoning fails, the fiend can try again as often as desired (once per round maximum) until it succeeds; treat these two summons as separate abilities (success of one does not affect the other)."

A stunned opponent cannot attack but can still defend themselves (no loss to AC). With either one of these weapons, the malebranche will still make use of its very sharp tail. It deals 1d4 points of damage and also causes the struck opponent to lose 1 HP every following round unless a healing spell or potion is used.",

When a victim is located, the night hag casts a powerful form of <strong>sleep</strong> which can affect any creature or character up to 12th-level or 12 hit dice unless a successful saving throw vs. Spells is made. Creatures who would be affected by a normal<strong> sleep </strong>spell do not receive a saving throw but are automatically affected. A victim who falls asleep will be strangled by the night hag and thus killed automatically, unless someone intervenes to stop her.",
      "Any victim who resists the<strong> sleep </strong>spell is not \"in the clear\" just yet, for the night hag will visit the victim once they fall asleep normally. The night hag will be in an ethereal (invisible and intangible) state, and after causing the victim to become ethereal she will climb on the victim's back and ride them until dawn. The exhausted victim awakens after such a night having lost one point of Constitution permanently.",
      "Naturally, any character reduced to a Constitution score of 0 is slain. Monsters are not normally chosen as victims, but should such a thing happen to a monster with no given Constitution score, assume it has a score of 10 plus its normal hit dice.",
      "Ethereal creatures can only be seen by other ethereal creatures or by means of <strong>detect invisible</strong>, and can only be harmed by magic weapons; most spells or magic will not affect such a creature but gaze attacks can do so. Once on the back of her victim the night hag can only be removed by killing her, but any strike against the night hag which misses has a normal chance to hit the victim being ridden.",
      "A night hag hates almost all creatures, and will often attack on sight so long as she believes she can win. Though her physical attacks are not particularly fearsome, night hags have several magical powers. As previously mentioned a night hag can become ethereal at will, and can resume material form in the same way; her movement rate remains the same while she is ethereal. She can also polymorph at will (as the spell <strong>polymorph self</strong>). Three times a day a night hag can cast a form of <strong>magic missile</strong> which launches a single missile that inflicts 2d8 points of damage. Worse, three times a day she can project a ray of darkness from her fingertip which can strike one character; the target must save vs. Spells or suffers weakness that reduces damage done by all melee attacks by half for 2d8 rounds.",
      "A night hag can summon an ally once a day. Roll 1d%: On a roll of 01-25 a vrock (page 159) appears; on 26-50, a barbed devil (page 145) responds to her summons. On a roll of 51-00 the attempt is a failure, but should this happen the night hag can try again as often as desired (once per round maximum) until she succeeds. If she does this the night hag must pay the summoned creature (if it survives) in the form of a larva from her collection, so she will only use this power if in dire need of assistance.",
      "When encountered on the material plane a night hag will always have a magical gemstone, a periapt, which will cure any disease contracted by the bearer, as well as granting a bonus of +2 on all of that character's saving throws. When carried by a non-infernal, the periapt has a 10% cumulative chance of decaying and crumbling when used; that is, 10% the first time it cures a disease, 20% the second, and so on."

This ability allows them to serve as steeds for demons and devils of various sizes. Night hags (page 154) and sometimes greater undead such as vampires, spectres, and liches may use nightmares as steeds.",
      "Besides attacking with its fierce bite and burning hooves, a nightmare exhales a cloud of smoke that both blinds and chokes any living creature within 10 feet unless a successful saving throw vs. Dragon Breath is made. Those affected by the smoke suffer a penalty of -2 on all attack rolls while within the smoke-filled area. Note that after moving to a new location, one full round must pass before the nightmare's smoke cloud is fully formed in this new area; on the other hand, the smoke in its former location does not persist at all after the nightmare moves away.",
      "Nightmares can fly naturally despite having no wings, but they do so by apparently running in the air; they can ascend and descend at up to a 45-degree angle at the given movement rate, and cannot dive or perform other maneuvers as normal winged fliers do."

It is subtle for an infernal, and can remain hidden among populations of humanoids or monsters for years without being detected. It prefers abandoned homes, old ruins, dark sewers, and tunnels as lairs. A shadow fiend grows stronger the more it feeds, as reflected in the variable HD amount above. When in darkness a shadow fiend is effectively invisible as per the spell. Regardless of whether it is in darkness or not, it moves in complete silence; only the stirring of the air is a hint as to a shadow fiend's passage.",

It can move said objects about 5 feet a round, also using this ability to hurl small objects at enemies within 50 feet for 2d6 damage. It will typically use this power to open and close doors, knock over objects, or throw small objects about. The goal is to terrorize and demoralize creatures it is \"haunting\", to induce fear and paranoia. In addition to this ability a shadow fiend can cast <strong>darkness</strong> and <strong>phantasmal force</strong> each once per day.

A succubus can change shape in a single round, and do so as often as desired. A succubus can speak any language, and has Darkvision to a range of 120 feet.",

Draining the life of a victim in this way is the succubus' preferred method of killing.",

In addition, this imparts the ability to get into small, tight, or difficult-to-access spaces. It is not uncommon for an issuv to wait in a crevice for prey to pass, and then come pouring out to attack.",

They are always encountered within a mile or two of the pumpkin patch where they originally grew. When a jack o'lantern is at rest or otherwise inert, it is impossible to tell from a normal fruit, as each can close its carved eyes, mouth, and other apertures and appear entirely ordinary.",

Anyone caught in the blaze suffers 2d6 points of fire damage; save vs. Dragon Breath for only half damage. Furthermore, they can fly (as the spell, at a rate of 20 feet per round) at will.",

This effect is otherwise as the <strong>sleep</strong> spell, and can be used any number of times per day. Note that any character facing a jackalwere who is aware of the creature's identity and knows of this power can easily avoid its gaze; only a truly unsuspecting opponent will be affected."

Once an opponent has been hit, the kraken wraps a tentacle around the victim and automatically inflicts 7d6 points of damage each round. When six of the tentacles are wrapped around a ship, the kraken may crush for 4d6 points of damage to the vessel each round. Victims caught in the kraken's tentacles attack at -4. If a tentacle takes 60 points of damage it's severed. Severed tentacles will regrow in 1d10+10 days.",

When a kraken has lost 5 of its tentacles or 50% of its hit points, it will emit a cloud of jet-black ink in a 100-foot cubic area. This can be repeated once per hour. The cloud provides total concealment, which the kraken will use to escape. Creatures within the cloud are automatically blinded."

They are equally dexterous with all of their arms, and may carry and use without penalty four weapons: a sword, a dagger or short sword, a short staff, and a switch (the switch is to drive off spirits). Some may replace two of their weapons with bucklers instead; the two bucklers count as one regular shield, giving krong reap thus equipped an AC of 19.

Each has elk-like antlers which may be used in charging attacks (following normal charging rules). Against large opponents the great leoporid will leap and use its rear clawed feet to rake for considerable damage.",
      "Domestication of a leoporid is a very long and difficult process. Riding one requires considerable skill and is a rough ride, but the great speeds make up for the discomfort. Unlike other horse-sized creatures, a great leoporid can turn quickly (having a 5-foot maneuver rating). Domesticated great leoporids are highly-prized as courier mounts in plains regions. A light load for a great leoporid is up to 250 pounds; a heavy load is up to 500 pounds. However, in either case specially-designed saddles and bags are necessary (those designed for equines will not fit)."

      "The \"wee folk\" are related to the other fey races of brownies, pixies, and sprites. A Leprechaun stands about 2 feet tall and appears as a miniature human. Its hair color can be blond, brown, or red with a predominant tendency toward a red shade of all the colors. A male leprechaun usually prefers to have a beard. Leprechaun clothing tends toward tans and greens with gold buttons and buckles. A leprechaun can speak various Fey languages and invariably speaks Common with a heavy accent called a \"brogue\". Leprechauns have Darkvision out to 60 feet. Because the wee folk are very suspicious of other races, a leprechaun is also very observant and will only be surprised by a roll of 1 on 1d6.",
      "A leprechaun prefers to live alone or in small family clans. Leprechauns can be found in forests, usually in unexplored or rarely-used glades. A leprechaun will have a lair that only a dwarf or halfling character can access. It will not willingly lead anyone to this lair. Leprechauns have a deep desire for gold and will have treasure that reflects this. A leprechaun is very fearful of humans and dwarves, because it believes that these races desire their gold. If there is an elf in the party, the leprechaun will ignore any human or dwarf leader and will address the elf, since elves are kindred fey spirits.",
      "Leprechauns use tools and will have tiny swords that are treated like daggers. It will rarely use small bows and cannot use pole weapons. Like a brownie, a leprechaun will get a +4 bonus to any saves vs. Magic.",
      "A leprechaun has some Thief-like abilities including Pick Pockets, Move Silently, and Hide, all as a 15th-level Thief. It also has spell-like abilities that can be used at-will, including <strong>teleport</strong>, <strong>confusion</strong>, and <strong>bane</strong>.",
      "A leprechaun will use the Hide and Move Silently skills to try and avoid a party. If a party does happen to catch one, the leprechaun will use Pick Pocket to steal any gold on the person that is holding it. The leprechaun will then cast <strong>confusion</strong> on the party, followed by <strong>teleport</strong>. Since it stays within a range of about 50 miles of its lair, it will generally be on target. If prevented from teleporting, the leprechaun will try to buy its freedom with treasure or three wishes. Note that the treasure may have a bane curse (see the <strong>bless</strong> spell in the <strong>Basic Fantasy RPG Core Rules</strong>). The wishes will be very limited. The leprechaun will fulfill the wish, but will put a twist on it that could severely hurt the wisher (the leprechaun will tell the wisher where a large treasure is, but fail to mention the two level-7 red dragons guarding it).",
      "There is rumor of a leprechaun king, an exceptionally wealthy leprechaun, with a very twisted idea of how to make a wish turn back on the person making the wish. An example: \"I wish for a mighty sword\" results in a <strong>sword </strong><strong>+3</strong> made from the tooth of a demon, but for every enemy killed with the sword there is a chance that the wisher will become a vampire."

      "A Lich is an undead former Magic-user or Cleric (of at least 10th-level with all spells and powers intact) who used dark magic to prolong its life into a state of undeath. A lich initially appears rather ghoulish or zombie-like, but after some time its body degrades and it begins to appear skeletal. In spite of its great powers, a lich will act to preserve itself by any means it has at its disposal. It knows the value and function of all magical items in its lair, and will use them to their greatest effect. ",
      "Simply encountering a lich for the first time is so terrifying that the subject must save vs. Spells or flee for 2d6 rounds. A lich's gaze is also terrifying; effective up to 30 feet, the affected target must save vs. Spells or be paralyzed in fright for 2d4 rounds. A lich prefers to attack with spells from a distance. A lich that hits a living target with its touch deals 1d8 points of damage and drains the victim of 1d4 points of Constitution while healing itself an equal amount of damage.",
      "The Constitution damage is permanent, a result of physical and psychic drain. Due to longevity and/or vitality traits, elves can ignore the first 10 points of Constitution drain; dwarves the first 4 points, and halflings the first 2 points. Lost Constitution can be regained at a rate of 1 point per casting of a restoration spell; nothing else (except a wish) can restore Constitution lost to a lich. Any character whose Constitution is reduced to zero dies immediately, but will rise in 1d4 rounds as a lesser wight under the command of the lich. Use statistics for the wight (in the <strong>Basic Fantasy RPG Core Rules</strong>), but instead of energy drain, the lesser wight deals 1d4 points of damage plus 1 point of Constitution damage. Anyone who becomes a lesser wight and then is slain is permanently dead and cannot be raised (but may still be reincarnated).",
      "A lich can only be hit by magical weapons or spells. Like a normal skeleton, it takes only half damage from edged weapons, and only a single point from arrows, bolts, or sling stones (plus any magical bonus). As with all undead, it can be Turned by a Cleric (as vampire, but with a -6 penalty on the check), and is immune to <strong>sleep</strong>, <strong>charm</strong>, or <strong>hold</strong> spells. Despite having Magic-user or Clerical levels, the lich uses 1d8 for rolling HP like other monsters.",
      "A lich's life-force is kept safe within an object called a canopticept, often hidden and protected. This allows the lich to persist even when its physical form is destroyed; in that event, the monster's physical form will slowly regenerate at a rate of 1 HP per hour. In order to completely destroy a lich, its canopticept must be located and destroyed; however, only very powerful magic or catastrophic natural damage (a <strong>disintegrate</strong> spell, a wish, or throwing it into an active volcano) can actually damage the object.",
      "The canopticept is sometimes incorrectly identified as a phylactery, possibly because some liches choose to use such a device of worship profanely in this way. A canopticept can in fact have almost any form, though almost all such devices fit comfortably in a person’s hand."

They hunt by hiding near intersecting subterranean corridors or similarly-restricted areas in the wilderness and leaping out at their prey, clawing and biting. This method of ambush is aided by their mottled brown and grey coloration, which resembles natural stone so well that they surprise on 1-3 on 1d6 in such surroundings; in \"finished\" dungeon areas or in non-rocky wilderness they do not receive this bonus, but still try to ambush prey in the same way.",

One will only release prey if it fails a morale check or is killed. These creatures are more interested in food than in killing, so once prey has been secured they will try to escape from battle back to the lair where they can eat in peace. They do not share well, though, and may fall to attacking each other if they capture fewer victims than there are lizards. Of course, so long as there are interlopers in their lair they will continue to fight them."

Whenever two or more shocker lizards are within 20 feet of each other, they can work together to create a lethal shock. This effect has a radius of 20 feet, centered on any one contributing lizard. The shock deals 2d8 points of electrical (lightning) damage for each lizard contributing to it (maximum 12d8); a successful save vs. Death Ray reduces the damage by half.",

Immature subjects may be as small as a fist, but those most often encountered are between two and three feet in diameter. Their shape suggests a sea urchin, though they are always found underground. Beneath a hard outer shell of iron lies the bright orange goo that serves as the loadstar's guts.",
      "When the loadstar strikes, its spikes dig into living flesh and deliver a fast-growing embryo. In one round, the wound site expands to form a blob under the skin, weighing 10 pounds and containing about 1 gallon of an orange liquid summoned from an extra-dimensional space. In the center floats the larva of the loadstar. If the site is lanced (doing another 1d4 points of damage) and squeezed immediately, the liquid may be flushed, killing the larva. Otherwise, the orange ichor converts to pure adipose tissue 10 minutes after injury. From that moment on, the fat must be lost in an ordinary way, typically through depriving oneself of food. 30 days after initial injury, a small loadstar emerges from the skin and floats away to find darkness.",
      "The immediate consequence of a loadstar sting is the burden of the 10 extra pounds carried. This extra encumbrance can be debilitating to smaller adventurers or those struck multiple times. Adventures may need to drop all of their belongings in order to escape.",
      "The curing of the disease, typically done by magic, kills the incubating larva but does not remove the excess fat. Clerics can return the body to its previous state with a <strong>restoration</strong> spell. Otherwise, the fat may be slowly lost at a rate of one pound per week by cutting the amount of food eaten. Intensive fasting can increase this rate to five pounds per week, but the subject must save vs. Death or else fail to complete the fast, making no progress for the week.",
      "Loadstars are mindless but will instinctively moderate their attacks, typically avoiding attacking a victim after it already carries one or more larva."

Although primarily used for fishing, this spear makes a formidable weapon.

      "A Werecockroach is a human (or occasionally other humanoid) who can transform into a gigantic cockroach. In human form, a werecockroach tends to be a thin, unkempt person, usually walking a bit hunched and typically fond of wearing long, brown overcoats or robes. A werecockroach dislikes sunlight and other bright lights, preferring to wander about at night or underground even when in human form. Regardless of current form, a werecockroach tends to scurry, stopping from time to time to sniff and look around.",
      "A werecockroach can assume the form of an enormous, unsightly 6-foot long cockroach. When in this insect form, a werecockroach is able to fly, albeit clumsily and slowly, and attacks by biting. In addition to this insect form, a werecockroach can also assume an intermediate form (a \"roachman\"). In this form, the werecockroach cannot fly and looks generally humanoid in shape, but has insect mandibles protruding from its mouth, two thin, long antennae on its head, shiny black bug eyes, spikes sticking out of its limbs, and four dark brown wings on its back. The roachman form shares the insect form's immunity to normal weapons, but must use a weapon to attack instead of biting.",
      "In any form, a werecockroach is immune to normal weapons, and one must use silver or magical weapons in order to harm it. A werecockroach has a bonus of +5 on saves vs. Poison, and is immune to most forms of disease, saving at +5 against any disease that the GM rules may harm it. However, a werecockroach has a weakness: it recoils from bright lights (as bright as sunlight or a <strong>continual light</strong> spell; twilight, torches, light, or lanterns won't affect it); a werecockroach must make a morale check when exposed to such a light, with failure causing it to scurry away to the nearest dark place."

A character that sees the true form must save vs. Spells (at -2 penalty) or else react as if struck by a <strong>cause fear</strong> spell, forcing the affected to flee for 2 turns. Anyone affected that is unable to flee will cower in place. Even those who successfully save are unnerved by the sight, and will have a -2 penalty to attacks or actions.",

Anyone struck by a maggot-man has a 2 in 6 chance (1-2 on 1d6) of being afflicted by a special form of rot grub (see the <strong>Basic Fantasy RPG Core Rules</strong>). Anyone that subsequently dies from the rot grub will rise as a zombie under the control of the maggot-man for a short time as maggots strip the flesh off the bones (2d4 days). If the maggot-man is defeated while such a rot-grub zombie endures, then the maggot-man will inhabit that body.

Additionally, attacks made against the mites that miss will do damage to the victim as long as the attack would hit the victim's AC.

The save may be repeated each round. While the victims are mesmerized, the remaining mesmerbellies will viciously club them to death.

      "They begin life as ordinary-looking mushrooms or toadstools, but continue to grow over the course of about a year to a height of about three feet, at which point they transform, gaining limbs and facial features. Young mushroom men (those having 1 hit die) do not yet speak and generally do not fight, though if cornered they will defend themselves. Each year a mushroom man grows roughly six inches, and every second year gains another hit die (so one will have 2 HD at 3 years of age, 3 HD at 5 years, and so on). They learn to speak their own language at the age of 2 and are considered adults at the age of 7 (at which point a mushroom man has 5 hit dice and stands about six feet tall). Mushroom men live short lives, most dying of old age before their seventeenth year (at which point any individual still living stands a full eleven feet tall and has 10 hit dice).",
      "Mushroom men have Darkvision to 120 feet, and move so quietly that they surprise on 1-3 on 1d6. However, they are peace-loving beings who will almost never start a fight, though the older individuals are known to be fierce when they are forced into battle."

The similarity ends there as the upper portion resembles something like a slimy salamander or eel. This soft vulnerable portion (AC 11) can be fully retracted into the carapace (AC 15) when threatened, with only its alien face showing through.",

For instance, one might produce a <strong>fireball</strong> effect made of green lightning, or <strong>magic missiles</strong> in the form of acid globes.",

      "An Octospider superficially resembles a giant spider in overall body plan, but the resemblance stops there. The main body is bulbous and fleshy, narrowing without seams to a kind of thick stalk at the bottom which then widens out into a flattened shape to which the eight legs are attached. The legs splay out to either side in a pattern very similar to that of an ordinary spider, but the legs are formed like the tentacular arms of an octopus, though shorter and thicker. The triangular pads on which they walk are covered with suction cups which allow them to climb vertical surfaces; they cannot, thankfully, cross ceilings or overhangs in this fashion. Two startlingly human-like eyes are positioned between the forelegs, with another eye between each other pair of legs including a single eye looking out from between the back legs. Finally, the octospider's beak through which it both eats and breathes is located underneath the lower body.",
      "Generally octospiders are grayish in color, mottled with small indistinct spots of tan, and their skin is moist like that of most other Nazgorean creatures.",
      "Octospiders possess all the features and limitations of other Nazgorean creatures, such as resistance to mind-affecting spells, weakness to sunlight and dry air, and so on. Due to their many eyes, they are hard to surprise, only being so affected on a 1 on 1d12 if their opponents are visible to them. Their vision is superior in that they can see invisible creatures 50% of the time and reduce the effects of partial invisibility or concealment by half (or double the chance of detection, depending on how the concealment is defined). Thus, individuals wearing an elven cloak are only 40% invisible to an octospider, while a halfling hiding in natural surroundings is noticed 20% of the time, or 60% when hiding in a dungeon. For Thieves, reduce the chance to hide by half.",
      "The main attack form of an octospider is a spray of noxious chemicals from a hard-to-see orifice between and just below the front pair of eyes. An individual can perform a direct spray, attacking any single target within 40 feet, or may perform a wider spray covering a cone 20 feet long and 20 feet wide at the far end. When attacking a single target, a normal attack roll is made; when spraying an area, all targets must make an appropriate saving throw.",
      "Further, the octospider has access to three different substances which it can spray.",
      "The first spray is a caustic liquid that inflicts damage directly, doing damage based on the monster's hit dice as shown on the table below. If a wide spray is performed, a successful save vs. Dragon Breath reduces damage suffered by half.",
      "The second spray is deadly poison; those subjected to a direct spray suffer a penalty on the usual save vs. Poison as given on the table below, while a wider spray delivers less poison and is thus easier to resist.",
      "The third spray is a kind of black gooey webbing that entangles the victim or victims. A direct spray entangles just one victim, who is allowed a save vs. Dragon Breath to avoid entanglement. The saving throw against a wide spray is rolled against Death Ray instead. This webbing is wet and sticky and does not burn, but it can be removed with application of at least a quart of wine or stronger alcohol; otherwise, the webbing dissolves after 2d8 turns.",
      "Each of these spray attacks can be used a maximum of once per day for each hit die the monster has. For example, a 4 HD octospider can use each of these attacks 4 times per day. An octospider can grapple a character and then deliver a bite, but generally does this as a last resort after spray attacks are exhausted. The bite damage is always just 1d4 points (even for the largest individuals). Use the normal wrestling procedures found in the <strong>Basic Fantasy RPG Core Rules</strong>, with the bite being delivered only as a second attack after a successful grab.",
      "Octospiders behave in a seemingly random and arbitrary fashion. Each group has a morale figure rolled as 1d6+6, for a range of 7 to 12. There is no particular or obvious reason for this fact; if adventurers escape from a group of octospiders, and then encounter them again, their morale should be re-rolled on each new encounter. All members of a group will have the same morale figure at any given moment."

    "description_paragraphs": [
      "A Tigersquid has the general body plan of a normal tiger, but its bulbous head has only a large squidlike beak; it has no eyes, ears, nor even nostrils. Tigersquids seem to sense their environment by means of sound alone, in much the same way as hydramanders, but tigersquids have far sharper hearing. They can sense a creature by its heartbeat, for example, and only magical silence will \"blind\" them.",
      "The most notable feature of a tigersquid is its tentacles; six short, powerful tentacles form a sort of \"mane\" around its head, and two long, slender tentacles serve as its tail. When stalking prey, the neck-tentacles lie flat against its back in rows, resembling a cape; when attacking, they fan out, making it look even larger than it is. The tail-tentacles twist and twine constantly, but are only used in combat if the creature decides to flee (i.e. fails a morale check).",
      "A tigersquid makes an attack roll for each of its neck-tentacles, attacking just one creature; on a successful hit, these tentacles hold fast to the victim. If the tigersquid hits with even one tentacle, the victim is immobilized (unless it can successfully lift or drag the tigersquid, which will weigh between 800 and 1,200 pounds). If it hits with two or more, it may automatically bite for 1d12 points of damage. (It will not attack with its bite in any other way; if it isn't holding its prey firmly, it will not try to bite.) If the tigersquid hits with three or more tentacles, the victim is no longer able to attack, or indeed take almost any other action. Once a hold is established, the tigersquid will continue to hold its victim from round to round, attempting to hit with any un-engaged tentacles and then biting if it holds with at least two.",
      "Instead of attacking (if this is possible at all), a victim hit by a tigersquid's neck-tentacles is allowed a save vs. Death Ray with Strength bonus (or penalty) added; if this roll succeeds, the victim has escaped one tentacle, and is allowed another roll immediately. So long as the victim succeeds at their saving throw, another save may be attempted, with each success freeing the victim from another tentacle.",
      "If a tigersquid fails a morale check, it will release any hold it has, turn suddenly, and attack with its tail-tentacles. Unlike the neck-tentacles, the tail-tentacles may attack two different targets (if two are adjacent to the monster) or both may be directed against one opponent. If either or both hits, they wrap around the target; a save vs. Death Ray with Strength bonus (or penalty) added is allowed, with success meaning that the target's legs are held but its arms are free. Otherwise, the victim’s arms and legs are held. Either way, any tail-tentacle that hits will detach from the monster and remain holding the victim, and on each subsequent round (not including the round when the attack was rolled) the victim suffers 1d4 points of damage from constriction. Detached tail-tentacles are AC 15, HD 1, and can continue constricting a victim for 2d4 rounds before dying if not killed sooner. A victim who fails the initial saving throw will be unable to escape without help, but if the initial save is made, a second save on a subsequent round will permit the victim to slip free.",
      "Regardless of the success or failure of this attack, the tigersquid will flee at top speed in the following round. Opponents adjacent to the monster may make \"parting shot\" attacks, as it is depending on the tail-tentacles to immobilize its attackers."

For fear of losing a tentacle, an octobat will not entangle larger or seemingly strong opponents, but against smaller or less powerful prey it will wrap itself about its target if two or more tentacle attacks are successful. The entangled individual is crushed and strangled, receiving 2d6 points of damage automatically each round (instead of regular tentacle attacks). The entangled individual must successfully roll an open doors attempt to break free, but may be entangled again in subsequent rounds.",

The octobat can also employ this attack against an entangled opponent. This attack is usable 4 times per day and not more than once every 1d4 rounds. This acidic ink can dissolve a<strong> web </strong>(such as the spell) in one full round. The octobat is immune to this acid ink (whether its own or from other octobats)."

      "Octopeople are unusual humanoid beings with what appears to be a large blue octopus replacing their head and shoulders. They have the ability to disguise themselves by donning the skin of a human or other humanoid, perfectly mimicking the appearance of their victim. This illusion can only be penetrated by means of the <strong>true seeing</strong> spell, or detected, though not seen through, by the <strong>detect illusion</strong> spell. <strong>Detect magic</strong> does not reveal this disguise, though other methods may be permitted at the GM's discretion.",
      "While wearing a skin disguise, an octoperson has a perfect resemblance to their victim. Additionally, by consuming the victim's brain, they can assimilate 60-90% (determined by rolling 1d4x10+50) of the victim's memories and knowledge. The GM uses this percentage to gauge how well the octoperson's acquired knowledge allows them to impersonate its victim. The victim’s skin is preserved by the octoperson's natural secretions, and remains viable as long as it is worn for at least ten hours within any three-day period. Failure to do so results in the skin becoming stiff and unusable. If an octoperson consumes a second brain, they lose the knowledge from the first brain entirely.",
      "In their natural form, an octoperson can attack with one of its tentacles. When struck with a tentacle, unless the target successfully saves vs. paralysis, they are paralyzed for 2d8 turns. This is usually done to capture victims for replacement or reproductive purposes.",
      "Octopeople operate by infiltrating positions of power by replacing influential individuals such as nobles or royalty, sometimes maintaining control over regions for generations. Although their purplish-blue blood can betray their true nature, in areas under their long-term rule, this characteristic has led to a belief among common folk that human nobles possess blue blood.",
      "Reproduction for octopeople involves laying eggs in living humanoid hosts. Usually those hosts have been paralyzed before being implanted with the egg, after which they are imprisoned for the three months it takes the egg to hatch. When the hatchling emerges, it takes its incubators skin as its first disguise. Over time, octopeople can replace an entire settlement's population, only revealing their true forms once complete control is established. However, they maintain their disguises to interact with outsiders and ensure a continued supply of humanoid hosts.",
      "The origin of the octopeople is shrouded in mystery. Some scholars speculate they are the result of a botched <strong>polymorph</strong> spell, while others believe they have always existed, only recently coming into public awareness."

      "The carapace of the oculus inferni has the ability to change colors. While this ability is basic and rather crude, combined with their silent flight ability it grants an otherwise-unsurprised oculus inferni the ability to surprise opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. When battle is joined, the monster's hide changes to a brilliant orange-red color.",
      "While it has a nasty bite, the main power of the oculus inferni is the ability to project a <strong>fireball</strong> (as the spell) from its eye once per round. The first <strong>fireball</strong> launched does 9d6 points of damage; each subsequent round this damage declines by one dice, i.e. 8d6 on the second round, 7d6 on the third, and so on, to a minimum of 3d6 per <strong>fireball</strong>. If the oculus inferni has the opportunity to rest, it increases its damage potential by two die in each round it does not use the power, to a maximum of the original 9d6 points of damage. This is often when the monster chooses to bite an opponent, if it thinks it can do so without suffering significant injury. Note that an oculus inferni is immune to all normal fire, as well as magical fire from spells of 3rd level or lower, while it suffers only half-damage from more powerful fire-based attacks.",
      "The oculus inferni will often choose to fly too high to be reached when fighting opponents who have only melee weapons (or who prove to have formidable melee attacks). Though it is vicious and aggressive, this monster is smart enough to choose to attack in ways where it cannot in turn be attacked.",
      "Attacks directed at its main eye may disable it, if damage equal to one-third of its original hit points is inflicted. The main eye will, however, regenerate when the monster's total hit points return to at least two-thirds of normal."

These lesser eyes are limited in their viewing angle, but despite that fact they reduce the chance that one can be surprised to just 1 chance in 1d8 if the opponent is visible.",
      "However valuable this resistance to surprise may be, it is the least of the powers granted by the many eyes of an oculus rex. The main eye projects a beam that <strong>dispels magic</strong> (as the spell) in a conical area 60 feet wide at the base and 120 feet long. This power functions constantly, virtually guaranteeing that all spells will eventually be ended, all potions and scrolls destroyed, and all permanent magic items suppressed in just a few rounds. The spell effect is applied as if the oculus rex were a spellcaster of the same level as its number of hit dice.",
      "The remaining eye effects are generally distributed as listed below, where the first eye listed is the eye just to the monster's right of center in front and proceeding around to the eye just to the left of center in front. About 20% of individuals have their eyes arranged in the opposite order, and one in a hundred (i.e. a roll of 00 on the dice) have them arranged randomly.",
      "The eye powers are as follows. Note that all spell effects are applied as if cast by a Magic-user of the same level as the monster's number of hit dice. Each eye can use its listed power once per round.",
      "Figuring out which eyes an oculus rex can use in a given encounter can be tricky. Please review the example diagram to help you see how to work this out.",
      "The gray area in the diagram shows what part of the battlefield around the monster can be targeted by eye number 2 (the slow eye, normally). This does not mean that all creatures in the area are targets at the same time, but rather that only those creatures within the area can be targets of that eye.",
      "Of course, the oculus rex can turn around whenever it wants to, but in the interest of fairness it should only be allowed to turn once per round, before performing its attacks.",
      "An oculus rex can suffer the loss of any of its lesser eyes without also suffering a loss of hit points. Severing an eyestalk requires 8 hit points of damage, or 12 hit points for the larger oculus imperius. Any successful hit to the monster's main eye which inflicts more than one-third of the monster's total (original) hit points in damage renders that eye useless. The monster regenerates slowly, such that any individual that survives an encounter will regrow any lost or damaged eyes (even the main one) and all will become functional when its hit points reach the normal figure once again."

      "The Oculus Rex is the largest and most powerful of all the oculi species, and the Imperial Oculus Rex (sometimes called \"Oculus Imperius\") is simply an even larger, older, and more powerful version.",
      "Besides the large central or \"main\" eye, an oculus rex has seven lesser eyes on short stalks arranged in a crown-like fashion. These lesser eyes are limited in their viewing angle, but despite that fact they reduce the chance that one can be surprised to just 1 chance in 1d8 if the opponent is visible.",
      "However valuable this resistance to surprise may be, it is the least of the powers granted by the many eyes of an oculus rex. The main eye projects a beam that <strong>dispels magic</strong> (as the spell) in a conical area 60 feet wide at the base and 120 feet long. This power functions constantly, virtually guaranteeing that all spells will eventually be ended, all potions and scrolls destroyed, and all permanent magic items suppressed in just a few rounds. The spell effect is applied as if the oculus rex were a spellcaster of the same level as its number of hit dice.",
      "The remaining eye effects are generally distributed as listed below, where the first eye listed is the eye just to the monster's right of center in front and proceeding around to the eye just to the left of center in front. About 20% of individuals have their eyes arranged in the opposite order, and one in a hundred (i.e. a roll of 00 on the dice) have them arranged randomly.",
      "The eye powers are as follows. Note that all spell effects are applied as if cast by a Magic-user of the same level as the monster's number of hit dice. Each eye can use its listed power once per round.",
      "Figuring out which eyes an oculus rex can use in a given encounter can be tricky. Please review the example diagram to help you see how to work this out.",
      "The gray area in the diagram shows what part of the battlefield around the monster can be targeted by eye number 2 (the slow eye, normally). This does not mean that all creatures in the area are targets at the same time, but rather that only those creatures within the area can be targets of that eye.",
      "Of course, the oculus rex can turn around whenever it wants to, but in the interest of fairness it should only be allowed to turn once per round, before performing its attacks.",
      "An oculus rex can suffer the loss of any of its lesser eyes without also suffering a loss of hit points. Severing an eyestalk requires 8 hit points of damage, or 12 hit points for the larger oculus imperius. Any successful hit to the monster's main eye which inflicts more than one-third of the monster's total (original) hit points in damage renders that eye useless. The monster regenerates slowly, such that any individual that survives an encounter will regrow any lost or damaged eyes (even the main one) and all will become functional when its hit points reach the normal figure once again."

It has no mouth, but rather has three jointed probosci arranged around its lower hemisphere; they fold up tight against the body when not in use and may thus be overlooked. The carapace of this monster is tough and resilient, and they are the swiftest fliers of all oculus species.",
      "The main power of an oculus somno is its ability to put its victims to sleep. Anyone who meets the gaze of one must save vs. Paralysis or be put to<strong> sleep </strong>(as the spell, but with no limit as to hit dice or levels that can be affected). An oculus somno will use its probosci only if it succeeds in either placing all members of a party into a state of sleep or driving them away. When it faces no opposition, the monster will move into a position where it can reach the maximum number of victims at the same time, and then pierce each one with a proboscis (this will not awaken a sleeping victim) and begin draining the victim's blood.",
      "For each 1d6 damage roll, the monster recovers one lost hit point (if any). Its appetite is not limited to these lost hit points, however, and it can and will drain dry more than a dozen man-sized victims.",
      "Oculus somni communicate with each other, and infrequently with other oculi, using an inherent telepathic ability; while it is possible for the monster to communicate with other species in this way, they rarely if ever choose to do so."

      "The Oculus Vigilans (sometimes called a Sentinel Eye) is an unusual member of the oculus family, for unlike the others they are not hateful nor voracious. One appears like most oculi, being a spherical body with a single large eye, a mouth below it (though in the case of this species the mouth points almost downward), and between 3 and 6 (1d4+2) eyestalks. The eyestalks are arranged starting near where a humanoid might have an ear, then proceeding up and over the main body in an evenly-spaced line ending with the last eye stalk where a humanoid's other ear might be. They are pale gray in overall coloration, sometimes tinged faintly with green or blue.",
      "The main eye of an oculus vigilans has a power similar to a <strong>ring of spell turning</strong>, projecting a cone of contrary magical force 100 feet long and 20 feet wide at the base (farthest point). Spells cast within this area of effect will rebound just as if the oculus were wearing such a ring.",
      "The other eyes of the oculus vigilans have powers selected from the following list:",
      "The GM should choose or randomly determine (by whatever means they desire) which powers each eye possesses, noting that normally no oculus vigilans has the same power in two or more eyes. The main eye of this monster can target only those in front of the creature, but all of its eyestalks can turn to focus on those who are behind it as well as in front.",
      "Oculus vigilans are only surprised on a roll of 1 on 1d6 due to their many eyes. Any hit to an eye (whether the main eye or an eyestalk) blinds and disables it.",
      "These creatures come from another plane of existence, and are summoned or otherwise compelled to service by powerful wizards or priests. They will be assigned to guard some location or treasure, but do not have (nor care to have) any of their own. They are normally faithful to whatever bargain they have made, but if one is blinded in all its eyes it will return to its own plane, disappearing instantly as its next action in combat."

A creature who successfully saves is immune to possession by that odeum for a full day; for this reason, an odeum may delay using this power until its victim has suffered several attacks, and thus has a Wisdom penalty.

An orog resembles an orc but is larger and more muscular, standing between 6 and 7 feet tall and weighing 250 pounds on average. An orog is highly intelligent and often leads a group of orcs or serve orcish leaders as special bodyguards. They sometimes hire themselves out as mercenaries for other humanoids and giants.",
      "An orog has Darkvision to 60 feet. It speaks the language of orcs as well as Common and possibly Goblin, Dwarven, or Elvish.",
      "An orog sometimes marches into battle carrying a special standard representing their clan. While fighting under a standard all orogs and allied orcs gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and morale.",
      "The statistics given above is for a standard orog in chain mail armor and wielding a two-handed weapon. One out of every eight orogs will be a seasoned veteran of 5 HD (360 XP) with a +2 bonus to damage. Normal orogs led by a seasoned veteran gain a +1 bonus to their morale. In lairs of 16 or more orogs, there will be a chieftain of 7 HD (670 XP), AC 17 (11), and has a +3 bonus to damage. In their lair orogs never fail a morale check as long as the chieftain is alive."

      "A Paper Tiger initially appears to be an ordinary scroll or book, and will almost always be found in a library or other large cache of similar materials. If opened and perused, the paper will expand and refold into the form of a life-sized origami tiger; this transformation requires a full round, during which time the paper tiger has AC 11, but as the creature surprises on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6 it is likely to complete its transformation unscathed. Paper tigers are white or cream-colored, with stripes made of closely-packed letters, numbers, runes, or other symbols.",
      "As soon as the paper tiger's transformation is complete it will attack. As a construct created to protect the library in which the paper tiger is found, the paper tiger will prefer to attack the character who activated it, and will continue attacking until the paper tiger is destroyed or all possible opponents have left the area of protection. Note that a paper tiger will not normally leave the vicinity of the library it wards, though if more than half of the books and/or scrolls are removed from the library the paper tiger may choose to pursue the creatures who took the items. Also note that if the paper tiger is taken away in book/scroll form without being opened, as soon as it is opened the paper tiger will attempt to return to the library, attacking anyone who gets in the way. ",
      "As a construct, a paper tiger is immune to <strong>sleep</strong>, <strong>charm</strong>, and <strong>hold</strong> magic, and has no mind which may be read using <strong>mind reading</strong>. It is immune to poison and any other effects that specifically harm living creatures. A paper tiger is especially vulnerable to fire, taking double damage from any fire-based attacks.",
      "If all interlopers leave the library and remain out of the paper tiger's sight for at least a turn, the creature will resume its original form, hiding among the books or scrolls of the library. In this form the paper tiger is very nondescript; even those who know such a creature is present will not usually be able to identify it, though anyone who previously activated the paper tiger has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 to do so. Adjust this roll using the creature's Intelligence bonus (i.e. a 13 Intelligence gives a 1-2 on 1d6 chance, etc.). While in book or scroll form, the paper tiger heals 1d6 points of damage each hour.",
      "If a library contains the sort of knowledge that the curator believes is too dangerous to ever be revealed the library may be warded by a Flash Paper Tiger. These creatures look and behave exactly as a normal paper tiger, but if slain or successfully attacked with fire a flash paper tiger explodes into a <strong>fireball</strong> (as the spell), dealing a number of dice of damage equal to the creature's HD. This <strong>fireball</strong> has the usual chance to ignite flammable materials in the area of effect, but as a special feature will instantly ignite any and all unprotected paper items the flames touch (a spellbook inside a backpack counts as \"protected\" and thus receives a saving throw, but a scroll held open by a character will instantly burn to ash)."

      "The primary attack of a giant porcupine is its quill burst, a blast of quills launched by a swift snap of its short but flexible tail. The quill burst consists of 1d8 quills launched at up to four adjacent opponents (divided up more or less evenly as determined by the referee); each quill does 1d4 points of damage on a successful hit. These quills are barbed, such that removing one causes an additional 1d4 points of damage; as they are up to 3 feet in length, leaving the quills embedded in a victim is usually not an option.",
      "A giant porcupine can bite for 2d4 points of damage, but will generally only do so after suffering more than half its hit points in damage, or in any case where one has failed a morale check but is cornered and cannot retreat.",
      "Worse, any attacker attempting to approach to melee range will automatically suffer 1d4 quill hits, except if the attacker is using a long weapon such as a spear or polearm (and is thus able to remain out of reach of the giant porcupine's quills). A giant porcupine has hundreds of quills, so there is little chance one will run out of ammunition in a fight.",

A prince frog comes in a variety of bold, striking colors, usually two-toned. Prince frogs prefer damp, warm conditions; swamps and jungles are their native habitats.",
      "It is the creature's eyes that led to its name. A prince frog has six eyes on stalks, arranged in a hexagonal pattern around the top of its head; these stalks are distinctly wider at the bottom than at the tip, giving the appearance of a crown. A prince frog can direct its eyes any way it wishes. Many eyes, combined with an excellent sense of hearing, means that a prince frog cannot generally be surprised. In addition, it is able to <strong>detect invisible</strong> continuously.",
      "A prince frog is an aggressive hunter, willing to take on prey larger than itself. Its success at this can be attributed to its poisonous skin, the secretions of which cause any creature coming in contact with one to save vs. Poison or become comatose for 2d4 turns. During this period the victim will have strange and horrifying dreams. A comatose victim cannot be awakened by normal means until the duration has expired.",
      "This poisonous effect should normally be checked for anytime a prince frog successfully attacks a character; in addition, the secretions remain fully potent for 1d4 turns after being separated from the creature. This means that weapons used to successfully attack a prince frog may cause the same effect if touched, though a bonus of +2 is allowed on the saving throw.",
      "Some believe that a prince frog is a form of a Nazgorean (see page 187) monster, but its bright colors have caused most sages to discount this theory."

During combat, they often focus on swarming an enemy, magically replicating themselves via their breath weapon, before roasting their opponent to a fiery crisp.",
      "Rabbidrakes may exhale a breath weapon in a 10-foot by 5-foot line, dealing 2d6 points of damage. After this, it must wait until it rolls a 1 on a 1d8 (performed before it acts each round) to use its breathe weapon again",

Only mature rabbidrakes may do this; the newly-created ones cannot combine breath weapons until they mature. Newly-created rabbidrakes can't use their breath until a 1 in 1d8 is rolled, as above."

It stands slightly taller than a halfling but tends to be leaner. Its eyesight is keen at night (double that of a human's nightvision), and even in total darkness has Darkvision out 30 feet. Just like halflings, rakuns are prohibited from using large weapons. ",

Even indoors or in non-preferred terrain it can hide such that there is only a 30% chance of detection. A rakun's ability to climb is extraordinary, receiving a substantial bonus to any such attempt, and when climbing trees the rakun almost never fails such a check under normal circumstances (effectively 100% unless circumstances carry substantial penalties).",

In any group of raptorsapiens, including mercenary groups, there will be one shaman with 1d4+1 Clerical levels.",

      "A Red Cap is a murderous fey that preys upon travelers seeking refuge in ruins or abandoned castles. Distantly related to both goblins and fairies, it appears as a small ugly man with unkempt hair, red eyes, and wickedly crooked teeth. A red cap wears small iron shoes and a blood-red hat upon its head; its shoes magically enhance its speed, so that if somehow removed the red cap's movement rate is halved. These shoes are useless to anyone other than a red cap. A red cap prefers to attack only helpless targets, usually with a knife or other bladed weapon that will spill blood.",
      "Within its lair a red cap has the abilities of a 6th-level Thief, including the sneak attack ability. Outside its lair a red cap's Thief abilities are only 3rd-level.",
      "A red cap can cast<strong> sleep </strong>once daily, which it uses to incapacitate those it intends to murder. When hard pressed, it will flee and hide, counting on its speed to evade any pursuers.",
      "The hat of a red cap must be soaked in blood regularly, lest the being wither and fade away. This hat, even if inert for years, can summon a red cap if soaked in blood anew. Only total destruction of the hat guarantees a true end."

Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8 points of bludgeoning damage plus 8d6 points of fire damage per round from the remorhaz’s gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 15). Once the victim exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut their own way out.",

Magical weapons are allowed a save vs. Dragon Breath to avoid destruction, adding any relevant attack bonus to the roll. Treasure recovered will probably be heat resistant, for obvious reasons."

A sasquatch is covered in shaggy hair befitting its environment so that it can hide effectively when it does not want to be seen. When more than one is spotted it is usually a family group with young.",

It does not keep treasures that other races seek, though one might find various crude objects and trinkets where it lairs.",
      "The sasquatch has nocturnal vision that is superior to human sight, though it does not have actual Darkvision. A sasquatch climbs nearly as easily as moving about by foot. Even for its size, the sasquatch hides in its home environment as easily as a halfling can in forested areas (with only 10% chance of detection), however they do not have this ability in other environments such as indoors or underground. A sasquatch is essentially immune to cold environmental effects and even extreme or magical cold causes half-damage. If a save is involved with such a cold-based effect it receives a +4 bonus. It fights effectively with its fists but if a weapon is used the sasquatch gains a +2 bonus on its attacks due to its tremendous strength.",

It also has a gaze attack that it chooses to either <strong>cause fear</strong> or <strong>bestow curse</strong> against a single target out to 30 feet who fails a savings throw vs. Spells. It also has a maniacal cackle that works likes the <strong>bane</strong> spell on anyone within 50 feet who fails a saving throw vs. Spells. Those who make their save are immune to the effect for 24 hours.",

Their native humanoid form, resembles an elf, though their skin retains a faint shimmer, as if still touched by the sea, and their fingers and toes are webbed. Selkies unique ability comes from the magical seal skin they all carry, usually worn like a cloak, when a selkie wraps itself in this seal skin they (or anyone who steals their skin) transforms into its a seal in but a single round. Remaining in that form until they remove the skin. Selkie guard their sealskins with their very lives, for without it, they cannot return to their seal form.",
      "In their seal form, selkies may only attack with their bite, but in their humanoid form, they use weapons, favouring daggers, spears or shortbows. ",
      "Selkies have a deep connection to the sea, which once a day allows them to summon a tidal wave that crashes over a 20-foot wide area. Creatures within the area must save vs. Breath Weapon or be knocked prone and take 2d6 damage. Those who succeed at the save take half damage and remain standing.",
      "Three times a day a selkie beneath the waters surface may become <strong>invisible</strong> (as the spell) for up to 1 minute as long as they stay submerged. Additionally, the Selkie can summon small sea creatures, such as fish or crabs, to assist with minor tasks (like gathering objects or disarming traps) for up to 10 minutes at will, as long as there is at least an hour between calls.",
      "Finally, selkies may sing haunting, magical melodies that cause creatures within 60 feet (except other fey) to save vs. Spells or become charmed (as per the spell <strong>charm person</strong>), entranced (as if affected by <strong>hold person</strong>), or fall into a deep sleep (as if affected by the <strong>sleep</strong> spell). The Selkie chooses the effect of its song, and creatures who successfully save against it cannot be affected by the same selkies song, in any of its forms, for the next 24 hours.",
      "Like other fey, selkies are vulnerable to cold iron. Weapons made of iron or steel deal an extra +1 damage, and disrupt their magic, halting all of the selkies magical abilities for the remainder of the round.",
      "Selkies are difficult to surprise at sea, only being surprised on a 1 on 1d6, though they can surprise enemies at sea on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6.",
      "A selkies skin if stolen, or removed from a defeated selkie allows anyone who wraps themselves in it to transform into a seal just like a selkie. However once the skin is removed from the selkies possesion the enchantment on it will fade within a year and a day leaving the skin nothing but a normal seal skin."

Owing to their habit of wearing their victim’s skin, they alternately appear as a skeleton or zombie. They fight relentlessly to attack the living in order to harvest skin, which they drape over their bodies, achieving an appearance more akin to a zombie with a patchwork hide.",
      "Quick on their feet, the skeletal flayer rushes to attack first with a long whip, grappling a victim in order to begin the grim work of harvesting skin. Such a whip attack does damage only to targets of Armor Class 13 or less, but always holds the target. In subsequent rounds, the flayer begins its butchery, automatically doing 1d6 points of damage with the curved blade. Following the Wrestling section in the <strong>Basic Fantasy RPG C</strong><strong>ore </strong><strong>R</strong><strong>ules</strong>, the victim may escape with a successful save vs. Death Ray, applying the better of their Strength or Dexterity bonuses.",
      "When unadorned, a skeletal flayer takes only half-damage from edged weapons, and only a single point from arrows, bolts, or sling stones (plus any magical bonus). Once donning at least one hide, it gains three advantages: +2 points of damage, half-damage from blunt weapons, and a 50' movement rate. As with all undead, they are immune to <strong>sleep</strong>, <strong>charm</strong> or <strong>hold</strong> magic. No form of <strong>mind reading</strong> is of any use against them, and they never fail morale, fighting until destroyed. They can be Turned by a Cleric as skeletons, unless wearing skin, in which case they are Turned as zombies.",
      "Successful skeletal flayers drag the mutilated bodies of their victims off to a charnel pit where the unused flesh rots from the bones, mixing with now-discarded worldly possessions."

      "A red slime can extend a pseudopod up to 2 feet per HD. If its attack is successful, the target is ensnared, and the slime will feed off the victim, dealing damage automatically each round. Hit points drained from the victim are added to the red slime's current hit points; every 8 points thus added increases the monster's HD by one, to a maximum of 6 HD. Excess hit points drained after the monster reaches its maximum of 48 are ignored. Note that the damage roll increases as the monster grows in size.",

A successful attack against a red slime may cause it to release a victim; the GM should roll 1d20, and if the die roll is equal to or less than the damage done to the red slime, the ensnared victim will be freed.",
      "A red slime can also regenerate 1 HP per round (up to what it had when encountered by the PCs), even if apparently slain. Damage from fire or acid will not be regenerated, and so this is the only way to permanently slay a red slime."

      "Although generally slow-moving, the spitting slug possesses a muscular internal \"mouth\" that it can extend outward rapidly to engulf a limb-sized object and latch on. Inside its mouth are small spines that secrete a paralyzing toxin (save vs. Paralysis + Constitution bonus or be unable to move) and digestive acids dealing 1 point of damage per round for as long as the slug is attached. A character wearing armor automatically saves, and does not take the acid damage* (see below). Characters that are affected by the toxin get a save each round to overcome the poison. If the victim is not paralyzed, treat this similar to wrestling with the victim as the defender.",
      "A slug which has successfully paralyzed its prey will attempt to swallow the victim, expanding its body to fit as much food as it can. Most human-sized creatures take 1d6+3 rounds to be engulfed, and as little as 1d4+1 rounds for smaller PC races. Even when engulfed, a victim may continue to make a saving throw or try to escape if not paralyzed. Any attacks against the slug while it is attached will deal half-damage to the victim.",

Armor may also negate the damage from the acid*. The acid is stored in special glands within the slug, so simply touching or even stabbing into the slug will not cause the object to dissolve.",
      "*The acid is capable of dissolving armor. Every point of damage from the acid reduces the armor’s AC by 1 to a minimum of 11, at which point the armor has dissolved beyond being useful, and the acid thereafter deals damage to the victim instead."

It has a natural long and narrow hypodermic tube (a modified tooth) to inject poison, and can launch it up to 20 feet. Stricken victims must save vs. Poison or be paralyzed for 2d6 hours. It swallows prey whole once succumbed. Each snail has but a single tooth to launch, and if this attack is not successful, the creature will retreat inside its shell. This gives it a bonus of +6 to its AC. The snail will then simply wait for any enemy combatants to give up and leave. A giant cone snail generally will not attack groups of creatures which outnumber it, but may lay in wait for a single opponent to become isolated and thus vulnerable."

      "A Thulid is a highly intelligent man-like creature with a squid-like visage and having four to ten tentacles surrounding a beak-like mouth. Though omnivorous, a thulid prefers the brains of sentient creatures as food. It can read minds (as the <strong>m</strong><strong>ind </strong><strong>r</strong><strong>eading</strong> spell) and communicate with each other telepathically. It can speak Common, usually to command slaves.",
      "A thulid uses its tentacles to extract the brain from a foe. It takes 1d4 turns for the tentacles to reach the brain, killing the victim. As this process takes a long time, it is not done during combat. In fact, most thulids are disinterested in physical combat, preferring to use their mind blast (see below), magic, or slave creatures for this purpose.",
      "About one-quarter (25%) of thulids are Magic-users (roll 1d8 for level). The experience point value of a magic-using thulid is greater than normal, and is shown in parentheses after the standard amount.",
      "The thulid's mind blast is a cone of mental force with a 60-foot range and a diameter of 50 feet at the far end. This ability can be used at most one time per day per HD of the monster, and may not be used more often than every other round. A thulid can choose to either stun or kill those within the affected area. If the thulid chooses to stun, those in the area of effect must save vs. Spells or be rendered unconscious (as if by <strong>sleep</strong>) for 2d6 rounds. A killing blast allows a save vs. Death Ray, with failure resulting in immediate death. Mindless creatures and the undead are unaffected by this attack. Add +2 to the saving throw if the victim is more than 20 feet from the thulid, or +5 if more than 40 feet away.",
      "A <strong>h</strong><strong>elm of </strong><strong>t</strong><strong>elepathy</strong> adds an additional +4 to saving throws. Further, when such saves are successful, the attacking thulid is stunned for 1d4 turns.",
      "When encountered away from their lair, a group of thulids will generally consist of at least one fully mature (8 HD) thulid, with the remainder having 2d4 HD each. See below for details on thulid growth and maturation.",
      "Thulids are actually a strange sort of parasite. When a group of thulids are encountered, the GM should roll 1d20. If the result of this roll is equal to or less than the number encountered, one of the thulids is ready to spawn. Do not count thulids who have only a single HD, as these are not mature enough to reproduce.",
      "If a thulid is ready to spawn, it will notify its brethren which of their opponents it wants to impregnate. The group will then attempt to render the target host unconscious (generally by using the stunning form of mind blast) while removing other opponents as expeditiously as possible. If the thulids prevail, the pregnant one will begin using its tentacles to penetrate the skull of the subdued opponent, but instead of extracting the brain, an egg will be laid. The subdued opponent will then be bound and carried off by the thulid party. Thulids seem to prefer male host bodies for no apparent reason. Humans are preferred over elves, and elves over dwarves or halflings.",
      "The egg hatches in 3d6 hours, but as the brain feels no sensation the victim will not realize this. In another 1d6 hours the victim will become confused (as if by the spell <strong>confusion</strong>), then in 2d6 more hours will fall into a coma. Up to this point, the condition is reversible with a <strong>cure disease</strong> spell, but after the coma begins, the growth of the infant thulid cannot be stopped in that way. In 3+1d6 days, the victim will suddenly awaken, still appearing normal but with the psyche (and mental blast power) of a thulid. The newly-spawned thulid can speak the Thulid language as well as any languages formerly known by the host body, though little or none of that host's mind is left otherwise.",
      "A \"newborn\" thulid normally has 1 HD. Over the course of the next year the new thulid will slowly transform, taking on a reddish skin tone and developing the distinctive thulid head; at this point the thulid gains its second HD. Each year thereafter, the thulid gains another HD, until the maximum of 8 is reached. Only a few thulids have the capacity to advance beyond 8 HD.",
      "If the victim is rescued from the thulids but the egg is not slain, the development will be exactly as given. When the victim awakens as a thulid, it will instinctively realize that it is not among its own kind and feign amnesia or other illness to avoid discovery until it can find its way underground and attempt to find its \"people.\" It is aided in this by its telepathy, which can be used to scan for other thulids within a 5-mile radius."

    "description_paragraphs": [
      "A Giant Tick is a blood-sucking insect about a foot long and is a more active hunter than its smaller kin. It typically first attacks by dropping out of a tree or other height when prey walks by, usually with complete surprise. It weighs little when not engorged, so usually the victim does not notice when a tick drops upon them. Adding to this, the tick's bite has an anesthetic quality, so the victim must save vs. Poison to notice the bite, which still causes 1d3 points of damage regardless. The GM should roll or otherwise keep results of these savings throws secret. Whether or not it is noticed, the tick drains blood for 1d4 points of damage every subsequent turn until either the victim dies or 20 such points of damage are drained. The hit points drained are not immediately noticed until the attached tick is realized. Each turn the victim may save again to notice the attached tick. After draining the mentioned 20 hit points from a target (or the target dies), the tick will drop off to finish its breeding cycle. An attached tick does not need to roll morale.",
      "The tick is very durable and difficult to remove. Using brute force requires a Strength ability check (see Ability Rolls section of the <strong>Basic Fantasy RPG Core Rules</strong>), but this will cause an additional 1d4 points of damage to the attached victim. Even killing the tick will not cause its head to be removed, so even with extreme care and taking over ten minutes will still cause the victim 1 additional point of damage during the process. Applying fire to a still-live tick may cause it to release the character (the tick may save vs. Death Ray with failure causing the tick to drop off) but will often cause the afflicted character 1d3 points of damage in the process.",
      "Making matters worse, giant ticks carry disease. Anyone bitten must save again vs. Poison or else be afflicted with an illness that causes the loss of 1 point of Constitution each day until death or a <strong>cure disease</strong> spell is applied. (During the course of the disease, these points may not be regained through rest as described in Constitution Point Losses section in the <strong>Basic Fantasy RPG Core Rules</strong>.)",

      "A Timber-Wolf is a manifestation of nature in a state of rage. It is composed of rough-cut or broken logs, branches, and leaves in the shape of a gigantic canine. A timber-wolf attacks by biting or trampling; in order to trample it must first move at least 10 feet. A timber-wolf can even attack structures like a battering ram, inflicting damage equal to its trample attack.",
      "Magical weapons or spells are required to damage a timber-wolf. As it consists entirely of wood, it takes double damage from magical fire attacks; ordinary fire, however, does only normal damage. A timber-wolf has a kind of basic intelligence, albeit in a state of rage. Exactly what brings forth a timber-wolf is not known, but attacks on a forest (such as excessive logging or similar devastation) may be the cause. When one appears, its primary motive is to destroy or drive out whoever (or whatever) threatens its forest."

Their skin comes in several different colors and hues and have little tufts of short and long feathers from the back of their wrists to their elbows, collarbones, and from the back of their heads to their upper back.

They are able to alter their surface coloration and texture to resemble virtually any kind of natural or cut stone, allowing one to fool onlookers and thus gain surprise on 1-5 on 1d6. Common ploys for a trapper are to form part of its body into a \"hump\" or other protrusion that might be mistaken for a chest, or to present the appearance of a hole or displaced stone that might cover either a treasure or the entrance to some small creature's lair; any of these methods might be used to lure intelligent creatures onto the trapper.",

      "It is when potential victims are standing on its surface that the trapper attacks, rolling itself up around them and crushing them. A 9 HD trapper can entrap at most 2 normal-sized characters (or twice that many small characters); a 10 HD one can entrap 3 such characters, an 11 HD one can entrap 4, and a 12 HD one can entrap up to 5. At the GM's option, characters near the edge of the creature's body at the time of attack may be allowed save vs. Death Ray to avoid entrapment, but those at the center are automatically captured.",
      "Victims wearing no armor suffer 3d6 points of damage each round; those in leather, 2d6, and those in metal just 1d6. Entrapped characters are held so firmly that they cannot use weapons, nor cast spells of any kind, though at the referee's option certain magic items may be usable.",

Like other treants, its legs fit together when closed to look like the trunk of a tree, and a motionless one is nearly indistinguishable from a normal tree. An apple treant is about 30 feet tall, with a “trunk” about 2 feet in diameter. It weighs about 4,500 pounds.",
      "During the warmer months, these treants bear fruit which are used as projectiles. This fruit can be hurled at tremendous velocities, causing 1d6 points of damage upon scoring a hit (range 120 feet), destroying the fruit in the process. The apple treant may fire off its fruit even while moving at normal rates to close distance with foes, upon which it attacks like any other treant.",

Most can also manage a smattering of just about all other humanoid tongues, at least enough to say “Get away from my trees!” Apple treants prefer to watch potential foes carefully before attacking. They often charge suddenly from cover to trample the despoilers of forests, or simply attack with surprise from the side of golden-brick roads."

Their hide and skin have a deep black and green color to them, while their hair is usually a weird shade of orange that’s unnaturally colorful. One other key physical feature for these creatures is that their noses are extremely long and pointy, to the point they could poke one's eye out. They have a great lust for anything shiny or see-through and they have a basic capacity for intelligence. In their very limited understanding of social norms, the marsh troll with the most shinies is the leader. As such, they could be bartered with, instead of fighting. Consult the monster reaction table in the <strong>Basic Fantasy RPG Core Rules</strong>.",
      "These creatures swim well, even better than their walking capabilities. As such, they are usually found around swamps, rivers, or lakes. In this instant, local townsfolk may have called them river trolls, as they were first discovered in marsh regions.",

They can regenerate slightly faster than their cousins due to their great adaptability. A marsh troll reduced to 0 hit points is not dead, but only disabled for 2d10 rounds, at which point it will regain 2 hit points. Note that the troll may “play dead” until it has regenerated further.",
      "If the marsh troll hits with one of its claws and a bite, they may perform a special attack, submerging the victim underwater. The victim must save vs. Paralysis or be dealt an additional 2d8 damage, or half as much on a successful save. If there is no water nearby, the marsh troll will simply bash the creature into the ground with this attack for 2d4 damage; no save is allowed.",
      "Damage from cold and lightning cannot be regenerated, and must heal at the normal rate; a marsh troll can only be killed by this sort of damage. The lower morale rating (in parentheses) is used when the troll faces attackers armed with cold or lightning. If a troll loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in one turn; or, the creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump. Marsh trolls are hateful creatures, reveling in combat and bloodshed. Though they could easily use a variety of weapons, they much prefer the sensation of flesh being rent by their teeth and claws."

      "Giant Sea Turtles are shy creatures which prefer to avoid conflict; however, due to their armor and their powerful bite they can be formidable enemies. Indeed, a giant sea turtle can swallow a victim of man-size or smaller whole on any natural roll of 19 or 20 on the attack die (assuming the attack hits); such victims can attack the creature's AC 13 interior only with short stabbing or cutting weapons such as daggers, but they suffer 2d8 points of damage per round from the creature's digestive secretions, making this a losing battle in most cases.",
      "Females come ashore on remote islands or rugged coastlines once a year in the early summer to lay a clutch of 2d8 eggs, which will be buried in the sand to be warmed by the sun until they hatch about six weeks later. Such egg clutches are often monitored by large, intelligent predators such as dragons, who will wait until the hatchlings break free from their shells and make a break for the sea. Hatchlings have 1 HD and do 1d4 points of damage on a bite, but will always try to flee into the sea rather than fight if they are given the option."

They prefer to shadow their prey from afar, often over a number of days in which they will move closer to harass and harry potential prey. Preferring to remain hidden from sight, they will make haunting calls and disorienting sounds to keep their quarry on edge and unable to rest. If they feel they may be up against a more formidable foe, they will often send in a few of their number to make a probing attack before committing to a main attack. These probing attacks are seldom to the death and will often retreat once they have acquired a good idea of the capabilities of their enemy.",

An ursavis prefers to attack from distance, either by dropping heavy rocks for 3d4 points of damage or by making swooping attacks with its claws. If both claws hit a medium or small target, the ursavis hugs it for 5d4 points of damage and swoops them away; each round after the victim is be hugged for 2d6 damage.",

Tribal protectors (about one-third of the population) wear leather (AC 13) or chain mail (AC 15) armor and will carry a medium-sized weapon such as a short sword, hammer, hand axe, or sometimes a sling. Their dwarf-like stature likewise limits weapon choice to those a dwarf can use (specifically excluding two-handed swords, polearms, and longbows).",

Once it senses living creatures within reach, it will form itself into a watery serpent in 1d4 rounds, striking suddenly out of the water to grab unsuspecting victims (and surprising on 1-4 on 1d6). The water weird cannot fully leave the water where it lives, but can reach up to 10 feet out of the water to attack potential victims.",

Spells that employ cold affect a water weird like a <strong>slow</strong> spell, while fire-based magic does half damage (or none, if the monster makes its saving throw). <strong>Magic missile</strong> does normal damage; most other spells have no effect (as determined by the GM). However, a water weird reduced to 0 hit points is merely disrupted, not killed, and the monster will reform with full hit points after 2d4 rounds. The only way to kill a water weird, strangely enough, is the spell <strong>purify food and water</strong>, against which the monster must save vs. Spells or be instantly killed.",

These lanterns, ignited with the same negative flame, emit an enveloping darkness akin to that cast by their pole lights. Wick wardens never travel alone, traveling in groups of at least two.

      "They are immune to magic that affects only living creatures (such as <strong>sleep</strong>, <strong>charm</strong>, or <strong>hold</strong>) as well as mind-affecting magic such as <strong>m</strong><strong>ind </strong><strong>r</strong><strong>eading</strong>. They take half-damage from any sort of cold or electrical attack. They are, however, especially susceptible to the spells <strong>haste</strong> and <strong>slow</strong>, suffering 1d6 points of damage per caster level if subjected to a <strong>slow</strong> spell and half that number of dice (rounded up) if subjected to <strong>haste</strong>. Neither spell has its normal effect if used against a wind walker."

      "Winged devourers are expert hunters, able to track their prey from a great distance before swooping down on them in a lightning-fast strike with either beak or talons.",
      "Finally, winged devourers also have a special attack. Swooping down on their victim from above, they use their powerful wings to create a gust of wind that knocks the victim off balance unless they make a save vs. Breath Weapon. If the victim fails to save, the devourer wraps its wings around them, not needing to roll to hit, then on the following round, and every subsequent round, using its razor like feathers it strips the flesh from its victims bones, causing 2d6 damage every round automatically. The victim can only escape if the devourer is driven off (forced to make a morale roll it fails), the devourer takes more than half its hit points in damage, or if the trapped character can roll greater than 17 on 1d20 (adding the character’s Strength mod). This attack is particularly gruesome and effective, but also leaves the winged devourer immobile and vulnerable to attack, however any attack made on the devourer while it has a victim wrapped in its wings will share the damage received, half to the devourer, half to the victim"

A wolpertinger has wickedly-sharp fangs, claws, and antlers that may be used to attack. The antlers are only used when charging (following normal charging rules for double damage), and then it will attack with claws and biting after such a charge. ",
      "Sometimes fey of the more wicked variety will utilize wolpertingers as mounts, otherwise groups of wolpertingers are usually encountered deep within densely-forested regions. A wolpertinger flies rather slow and clumsily, with flight being used primarily for short distances to get over impassable terrain; aerial encounters would therefore be rather rare.",
      "A wolpertinger's pelt is similar to high-quality rabbit or mink fur, but due to its rarity commands a price of over 100 gp just for the rough pelt. Worked fur garments are therefore even more valuable. Its antlers are often worked into objects such as knife handles or even as embellishments on bier steins."

      "Wondrous Guardian Automatons are seven-foot tall steel humanoid skeletons plated in steel or bronze and animated by means of clockwork, steam, and magic. The original wondrous automatons were constructed by a mad wizard whose name has been lost to history. The wondrous constructs are often found guarding libraries of magical tomes and scrolls, or treasure vaults.",
      "Guardian automatons range in appearance, from nothing more than a drab but intimidating gray steel clockwork automaton, to resplendent gleaming brass and copper. Its inner workings are usually covered by metal plates, which depending on how ornate the automaton is can be plain steel plates or ornately-engraved and decorated brass.",
      "Though the original wondrous guardian automatons were created by knowledgeable wizards and artificers, the vast majority of the ones existing now have been created by an Automaton Primus (as described below). Groups discovered in the wild are often either book-collecting parties, or more rarely groups that have left a library-fortress to found a new one.",
      "Wondrous guardian automatons can wield almost any weapons, but prefer crossbows and axes. In combat, it can either attack with any weapons it is equipped with, or expel a cone of hot steam from its mouth in a 10-foot cone that does 1d12 points of damage, unless those hit by it save vs. Dragon Breath for half damage. However, it takes 5 rounds after it breathes its steam attack before it can build enough pressure to use this attack again.",
      "Every tenth automaton will be an Automaton Alpha (555 XP); these stand 9 feet tall and are decorated with silver embellishments. Alphas can breathe steam every 3 rounds for 2d12 points of damage, have 6 HD, save as a 6th-level Fighter, and are more heavily-armored (AC 20). Every group of 50 will be lead by an Automaton Primus (1,390 XP). These towering 12-foot tall automatons are decorated with gold, have 10 HD, save as a 10th-level Fighter, can breathe flame-infused steam for 3d12 points of damage every two rounds, and are even more heavily-protected, having AC 22, and are capable of creating new wondrous guardian automatons. They will often be found in a workshop with several incomplete automatons."

It has large eyes that are mounted on either side of its head, giving it excellent peripheral vision, and can only be surprised on a roll of 1 on 1d6. A worm man can exist on minerals for a time, though bands of worm men often make forays to the surface to acquire decaying organic matter to supplement their diet. A worm man is immune to the <strong>sleep</strong> spell.",
      "Each worm man has a spell-like ability that functions like a <strong>charm person</strong> spell. However, it has the limitation that the effect will fade once the worm man loses eye contact with the victim. The worm man may use this ability once per day and often leads with it during combat.",
      "Worm men live in large communities apart from the other underground civilizations. However, they are often willing to be hired as soldiers by other races. Recently, they have begun to take a more aggressive stance toward the surface, perhaps deciding the time is right for them to consider a campaign of conquest."

Its body is long and segmented, covered in slick, oily skin, with dozens of jointed legs protruding from its sides, a twisted human-like visage, sits at the front of its hideous body, with hollow, black eyes and a mouth that opens vertically, revealing rows of needle-like teeth.",
      "When a wretchling senses intelligent beings nearby, it selects one at random and begins stalking them. Once it manages to get within 40 feet of its target undetected, it will attack. If it succeeds in its attack roll, the victim must save vs. Spells. On a successful save, the victim becomes immediately aware of the wretchling, however they will also be stunned for a single round unable to act. However, if the save fails, the wretchling’s body dissolves into a dark, smoky mist that enters the target's body through their eyes, nose, and mouth, allowing the wretchling to possess its new host.",
      "During the first stage of possession, the host appears completely normal, but everyone within 100 feet will begin to experience terrible nightmares, initially only during sleep, but later even while awake. These nightmares start with visions of writhing, centipede-like appendages creeping from the corners of their vision, accompanied by a feeling of dread, often accompanied by cold sweats.",
      "Over the next few days, the visions increase in frequency and severity, including hearing a faint, constant whispering that leaves the victim uneasy and physically ill. At this point, the wretchling manifests as a small child that only the host can see, leading to frequent conversations with thin air, that others may notice. If attacked with a magical weapon or spells, the wretchling is forced out of the host's body and will attempt to possess the nearest being. This can be prevented by encircling the host with salt, a substance wretchlings despise. Without intervention, all those near the host will soon begin to experience violent visions targeting friends and allies, with louder whispering urging them to attack.",
      "It is at this point the host enters the second stage. The character must succeed in a second save vs. Spells or die, their eyes turning a glossy black. In 1d6 hours, they rise as an undead being, Turnable as a zombie, but still under the wretchling’s control. The host will then sow even more discord among allies, even attacking companions in the night and feasting on their flesh. Eventually, the wretchling sheds the remnants of its host, after becoming gorged and gaining two extra hit dice, though its movement speed is halved while gorged. All those killed by a wretchling have a 20% chance of rising as a zombie within three days."

A xorn does not attack fleshy beings except to defend itself or its property since it cannot digest meat. A xorn is indifferent to non-elemental creatures, with the sole exception of anyone carrying a significant amount of precious metals or minerals, which a xorn eats. A xorn can smell food up to 20 feet away and can be quite aggressive when seeking food. ",

Groups of xorns often send one of their number to the surface to negotiate for food while the remainder position themselves for a surprise attack. A xorn can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth (except metal) as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A <strong>move earth</strong> spell cast on an area containing a burrowing xorn flings the xorn back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it saves vs. Spells."

Towering between 7-11 feet tall, these hulking creatures are covered in thick, dark or reddish-brown hair. Yowies are carnivorous with a particular taste for human and demi-human flesh.",
      "Their long, powerful arms end in sharp claws and their slavering maws are full of jagged teeth. As part of its nocturnal adaptations, the yowie has Darkvision with a range of 120 feet.",
      "Yowies stink, they have a foul odor that can overwhelm anyone who gets too close. Any creature within 10 feet of the Yowie must save vs. Poison or be nauseated, suffering a -2 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws for 1d6 rounds.",
      "Three times a day, the yowie can let out its terrifying, haunting cry. All creatures within earshot must make a save vs. Paralysis or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds.",
      "Yowies are found either alone or in small family groups, they are fiercely territorial and aggressive in their lair, fighting to the death to defend it (treat their morale as 11 when encountered in their lair). Despite their animalistic appearance, they possess a cunning intelligence, setting rudimentary traps or using basic tools. They usually lair, in caves or dense thickets, usually strewn with the remains of their unfortunate victims and any treasure those victims might have carried."

They use these beings as vanguards for their armies, sometimes to even make strategic decisions for them.",

If abandoned, consciousness may develop and the creature might even become intelligent enough for independent thought and personality.

Most necromancers agree that the aura comes from the soul energy that emanates from this undead. The skin seems dead but preserved, way more whole and life-like than most other zombies.",

They can also deal an additional 1d6 points of damage if both of their attacks hit, as the overexposure to the soul energy is quite taxing on both the living and the dead. This damage is doubled if it is inflicted on the undead. They take only half-damage from blunt weapons, and only a single point from arrows, bolts, or sling stones (plus any magical bonus). Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to <strong>sleep</strong>, <strong>charm</strong>, and <strong>hold</strong> magics.

Use the higher morale figure when a barkling group outnumbers their enemies by 3 combatants to 1 or more.",

In barkling encampments, one out of every twenty will be a chieftain of 2 hit dice (75 XP) having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In villages of 50 or more there will be a barkling lord of 3 hit dice (145 XP) who has +1 bonus to damage. Barklings gain a +1 bonus to their morale as long as they are led by any of their leaders.",

For XP purposes, treat the wizard barkling as if it has a number of hit dice equal to its magic-user level ‑1, and assign one special ability bonus asterisk.",

It is possible to use a mirror to fight the monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its own reflection in a mirror it must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power to petrify.

Teleportation is so easy for them that they can sometimes teleport away before being attacked. When one knows of the attacker's action (i.e. can see or possibly hear the attack about to happen) it is allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray, and on a successful roll it teleports 1d6 x 10 feet in a random direction (but never into solid matter, nor into any dangerous area the creature knows about).",

In this way, some members of the pack will be able to attack from behind, a trick they are so good at that they receive the same benefits as a thief: +4 to hit and double damage if the hit is successful.",

They communicate using a language of barks, growls, and yips which is somewhat limited but can convey useful tactical information.

      "Blood roses appear to be normal rose bushes, but are actually animated plants, dimly aware of their surroundings. These plants are always in bloom, bearing beautiful flowers that are normally white (or rarely, yellow) in color.",
      "The fragrance of the flowers is detectable up to 30' from the plant in ideal conditions. Blood roses can move about slowly, and will try to find locations sheltered from the wind in order to achieve those ideal conditions. Living creatures who smell the fragrance must save vs. Poison or become befuddled; such a victim will drop anything carried and try to approach the plant. Each round an unaffected living creature can smell the fragrance it must make this save. Befuddled creatures will not resist the attacks of the blood rose; if affected creatures are removed from the area, the effect of the fragrance will expire 2d4 rounds later. Undead monsters, constructs, etc. are not affected.",
      "Each blood rose plant will have 1, 2 or 3 whiplike canes studded with thorns with which it can attack. When a cane hits, it wraps around the victim and begins to drain blood, doing 1d6 points of damage per round. A blood rose which has recently (within one day) \"eaten\" in this way will have flowers ranging from pink to deep wine red in color, which will fade slowly back to white or yellow as the plant digests the blood it has consumed."

      "Giant cave locusts are pale, cricket-like creatures that live underground. An average giant cave locust is 2 to 4 feet long. They are eyeless, depending on their sound-sensitive antennae, vibration-sensitive feet and a variety of touch-sensitive \"hairs\" on their legs to sense the environment around them.",
      "These creatures eat subterranean fungus (including shriekers) as well as carrion; they are not predators, but if disturbed they will attack, shrieking loudly, biting, jumping wildly around, or spitting nasty goo.",
      "All giant cave locusts in a group will shriek when disturbed, attracting wandering monsters. The GM should roll a wandering monster check each round that one or more cave locusts are attacking; if wandering monsters are indicated, they will arrive in 1d4 rounds.",
      "Any giant cave locust that is engaged (adjacent to an opponent) will attempt to bite, doing 1d2 damage on a successful hit. This does not interrupt the monster's shrieking.",
      "A giant cave locust can leap up to 60' horizontally, or up to 30' up. If one of these creatures is not engaged at the beginning of the round, it will leap toward one of the opponent creatures; roll a normal attack roll, and if the attack hits, the target creature takes 1d4 points of non-lethal damage from the impact.",
      "Finally, a giant cave locust can spray a greenish-brown goo (its digestive juices) up to 10' away. Each giant cave locust can perform this attack just once per encounter. This spit attack will usually be reserved until they fail a morale check, in which case all remaining giant cave locusts will spit at their nearest opponent, and then all will attempt to flee in the next round. To spit on an opponent, the giant cave locust rolls an attack against Armor Class 11 (plus Dexterity and magical bonuses, but no normal armor value applies). If the attack hits, the target must save vs. Poison or be unable to do anything for 3d6 rounds due to the horrible smell."

Up to two adjacent man-sized or up to four smaller opponents may be trampled simultaneously; the triceratops rolls a single attack roll which is compared to the Armor Class of each of the potential victims, and then rolls a separate damage roll for each one successfully hit. The gore attack may only be used against a single man-sized or larger creature, but may be used in the same round as the trample if the creature being gored is larger than man sized.

The color dulls and darkens with age until it reaches an almost uniform tan color at the oldest age category. They have long sinuous bodies and unusually long legs, giving them the fastest land movement rate of any dragon, but they are also accomplished fliers, as fast and maneuverable as any dragon.",
      "Plains dragons may hunt on the wing, attacking suddenly from above and surprising on 1-3 on 1d6; or, they may lie in wait in tall grass or a copse of trees, using their coloration as camouflage. As one ages and its colors dull, this ability improves; when lying in wait, they gain surprise on 1-3 on 1d6 at age categories 2 and 3, on 1-4 in age categories 4 through 6, and on 1-5 at age category 7.",

The breath weapon of a sea dragon is a cloud of steam; they are immune to damage from non-magical steam (including the breath weapon of another sea dragon), and suffer only half damage from magical steam attacks.",

A dryad’s oak does not radiate magic. A dryad lives as long as her tree, and dies when the tree dies; likewise, if the dryad is killed, her tree dies also.",
      "A dryad resembles an elf woman, with skin like fine polished wood or smooth bark and hair like leaves; the hair color of a dryad usually changes with the seasons, being brown in the winter, pale green in the spring, darker green in the summer, and yellow, orange, or red in the fall. ",
      "Though they are usually content to live alone, dryads are often friends with creatures such as treant or other nature spirits who might live nearby. Once per day a dryad can cast a charm similar to the spell <strong>charm person</strong>, and one may choose to use this ability to compel an interesting human or elf to remain with her as a companion for a period of up to a year. The companion can be taken into and brought out of the dryad's tree so long as the charm is still in effect."

Eagles are known to carry prey up to 15 lbs. An eagle will also kill and start to eat animals that are 5 times the eagle's size, up to 80 lbs. Fish-eating eagles are usually the largest varieties, while other types hunt small animals such as rodents or snakes. Coloring is dependent on the species of eagle, and should be chosen by the GM; various brown, gray, black, or white markings are most common, though solid darker colors are sometimes seen. The beaks may range from bright yellowish orange to black. Eagles will dive at a prey and attack with both sets of talons, then attack with the beak."

However, when they hunt they do so in a solitary fashion, with each eagle choosing a single creature as prey. As they can communicate with each other, it is extremely rare for two of them to make the mistake of attacking the same prey; in fact, it is not uncommon for one to attack alone to scatter a group of prey so they can each more easily choose a victim.",

Create flame allows the efreet to cause a flame to appear in its hand or otherwise on its person at will; it behaves as desired by the efreet, becoming as large as a torch flame or as small as a candle, and ignites flammable material just as any ordinary flame does. The flame can be thrown as a weapon with a range of up to 60', causing 1d8 points of damage on a successful hit. The efreet can create another flame, and throw it as well if desired, once per round.",

      "A ghost is the soul or spirit of a deceased sentient creature that has for some reason remained on the material plane. They usually appear as they did in life, but sometimes the appearance of a ghost is altered by its original personality; for instance, the ghost of an angry person might have a threatening or even demonic visage. Ghosts are <strong>undead</strong>, and as such are immune to <strong>sleep</strong>, <strong>charm</strong>, and <strong>hold </strong>magic.",
      "Seeing a ghost is so terrible that any living creature who does so must save vs. Spells or flee for 2d6 rounds. Anyone who successfully makes this save may not be so affected by that ghost again.",
      "A ghost that hits a living target with its touch attack does 1d8 points of damage, and at the same time regenerates the same number of hit points. In addition, the victim loses 1 Constitution point. Elves and dwarves (and other long-lived creatures such as dragons) are allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to resist this effect, which must be rolled on each hit. Characters who lose Constitution appear to have aged. If a ghost is fighting a living creature which does not have a Constitution score, the GM should assign whatever score they see fit.",
      "Like most incorporeal creatures, ghosts may normally be hit only by magical weapons. However, if a ghost makes use of its touch attack, it becomes vulnerable to non-magical weapons until the beginning of the next round of combat.",
      "Lost Constitution can be regained at a rate of one point per casting of <strong>restoration</strong>; nothing else (except a <strong>wish</strong>) can restore Constitution lost to a ghost. If a character's Constitution falls to 0, they die permanently and cannot be <strong>raised</strong> (but still may be <strong>reincarnated</strong>).",
      "Once per turn, a ghost can use <strong>telekinesis</strong> (as the spell) as if it were a 10th level Magic-User.",
      "Instead of attacking, a ghost may attempt to possess a living creature. This ability is similar to a <strong>magic jar</strong> spell (as if cast by a 10th level Magic-User), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be able to move into the target (so it is possible to avoid this attack by outrunning the ghost). The target can resist the attack with a successful save vs. Spells. A creature that successfully saves is immune to being possessed by that ghost for 24 hours. If the save fails, the ghost enters the target's body and controls it; control may be maintained until the ghost chooses to leave the victim's body, or until it is driven out by means of a <strong>remove curse</strong> or <strong>dispel evil</strong> spell. While it is possessing a living creature, a ghost may not use any of its special abilities."

They have long lives, with most surviving to 400 years barring disease or misadventure.",

They wear the finest clothing, make and eat the best food and drink, and live in castles built on high mountains or even in the clouds themselves. Like most giants, they are suspicious of the smaller races, but cloud giants do not usually prey upon them, preferring instead to demand tribute from smaller humanoids living nearby.",
      "Despite being self-centered, they fight in highly trained units that use sound tactics; their belief in their own superiority allows no less. Attacking from above is preferred, and ranged attacks are always considered better than melee. To that end, cloud giants can throw large stones up to 200' for 3d6 points of damage each. Also, 5% of cloud giants have the abilities of a Magic-User of level 2 to 8 (2d4). A favorite tactic is to encircle enemies, barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities confound them with spells. In battle, cloud giants wear finely crafted, intricately engraved plate mail."

Females are slightly smaller, standing 22 feet tall on the average and weighing around 14,000 pounds. They look very much like enormous, thickly built hill giants, and among humans they are often seen as little more than that. This is underselling the mountain giants, however, for though their crafting is primitive they have an intricately detailed social structure.",
      "Mountain giants live in clans, led by the oldest male and female (or by their oldest offspring if the elders choose to delegate leadership due to advanced age). Each clan rules over and controls a group of 1d6 mountain peaks, generally spanning an area with a 5-6 mile diameter. They prefer peaks connected by high ridges so that they do not have to descend too far when walking their territory. Clan members who are mated establish households within the territory; unmarried members typically live with their parents until they are wed. The \"lair\" encounter figures above are for a single household, but if one household is attacked and the attackers subsequently retreat, upon their return they will usually find much of the rest of the clan waiting for them in ambush.",
      "They wear armor made of wood held together with heavy rope, and wield giant clubs or staves carved from fully grown trees harvested from the lower reaches of their territory. If they live near storm giants, they may trade for better weapons (the second damage rating given above) but usually cannot afford storm giant armor.",

Their ears are pointed, not in as pronounced a fashion as elves but certainly noticeable, and their noses likewise are pointed a bit more than those of most other kinds of humanoids. Their preferred habitat is the forest, preferably in a hilly temperate region.",
      "They have Darkvision with a 30' range. When attacked in melee by creatures larger than man-sized, gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class. Outdoors in their preferred forest terrain they are able to hide very effectively; so long as they remain still there is only a 20% chance they will be detected. If one or more gnomes who are successfully hiding attack from ambush, they surprise their foes on 1-4 on 1d6.",
      "Gnomes have their own language, and many also know the language of the dwarves. Some gnomes make their living as traders, often acting as go-betweens for dwarves and humans, and those gnomes naturally tend to learn Common. Those who are engaged in defending their forest settlements from humanoid incursions often choose to learn Goblin or Orc.",
      "Gnomes encountered in the wilderness (who are not traders or merchants) are likely to be unfriendly, but not hostile. They tolerate dwarves but dislike most other humanoid races. When forced to interact with other races, a gnome will generally be recalcitrant, unless offered a significant amount of treasure.",
      "The statistics given above are for warriors. In a settlement or lair, for every warrior there will be an average of three civilians having 1-1 Hit Dice and Armor Class 11; such gnomes have Morale of 7. One out of every eight gnome warriors will be a sergeant having 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a sergeant. Both warriors and sergeants commonly wear chainmail. In gnomish communities, one out of every sixteen warriors will be a captain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) with an Armor Class of 16 (11), adding a shield. In addition, in communities of 35 or greater, there will be a king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor Class of 18 (11), in plate mail and carrying a shield, having a +1 bonus damage due to strength. In their community, gnomes never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive. There is a chance equal to 1-4 on 1d6 that a community will have a Cleric of level 1d6+1, and 1-2 on 1d6 of a Magic-User of level 1d6. Gnomish Clerics use 1d6 hit dice and Magic-Users use 1d4 hit dice, and in all other ways behave as if they were normal characters."

      "Once in reach of a harpy, a charmed victim will surrender completely, even allowing the harpy to attack and kill it without putting up any sort of resistance. The charm effect lasts one full round after all harpies have ceased singing."

These monsters are native to another plane where they hunt in packs; sometimes powerful wizards or evil priests summon them for use as watchdogs. In addition to biting, each hellhound may breathe fire a number of times per day equal to its hit dice. In combat, one-third of the time (1-2 on 1d6) a hellhound will choose to breathe fire; otherwise it will attempt to bite. Roll each round to determine which attack form will be used.",

This breath weapon does 1d6 points of damage per each hit die of the hellhound to all within the area of effect; a successful saving throw vs. Dragon Breath reduces damage to half normal.",

If a character using a melee weapon chooses to strike at a particular head (i.e. states such intent to the GM) and succeeds in doing 8 points of damage, that head is disabled (severed or severely damaged) and will not be able to attack anymore. Such damage also applies to the monster's total hit points, of course.",

A very few hydras can breathe fire; those that have this ability can emit a flame 10' wide and 20' long one time per head per day. This attack will be used about one time in three (1-2 on 1d6) if it is available; roll for each head which is attacking. Each such attack does 3d6 damage, with a save vs. Dragon Breath reducing the amount by half.

If the swarm consists of crawling insects, it covers three 10' squares and the flying movement above is ignored.",

      "Damage is reduced to a single point per round for three rounds if the character manages to exit the swarm. It is possible to \"ward off\" the insects by swinging a weapon, shield, or other similar-sized object around, and in this case damage is likewise reduced to 1 point per round. If a lit torch is used in this way, the swarm takes 1d4 points of damage per round. Weapons, even magic weapons, do not harm an insect swarm. An entire swarm can be affected by a <strong>sleep</strong> spell. Smoke can be used to drive a swarm away (if the swarm moves away from any victims due to smoke, the damage stops immediately). Finally, a victim who dives into water will take damage for only one more round."

A non-magical metal weapon used to attack the monster does half damage before being destroyed. Magic weapons or armor lose one \"plus\" each time they make contact with the ironbane; this loss is permanent.",

      "Kobolds prefer to rely on ranged combat whenever possible. They tend to favor daggers and short spears since both can be used in close quarters or thrown at foes at range. Some may be armed with diminutive bows or crossbows which inflict 1d4 points of damage on a hit.",
      "Kobolds normally dwell underground, while those who choose to dwell above ground may adopt a nocturnal lifestyle. All possess Darkvision with a range of 60 feet, and generally avoid exposure to daylight. When they are exposed to sunlight or the effect of <strong>continual </strong><strong>light </strong>they suffer a penalty of -1 to all attack rolls. Most kobolds wear leather armor in combat.",
      "One out of every six kobolds in any group is a warrior with 1 hit die (25 XP). Kobolds gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In kobold lairs, one out of every twelve is a chieftain of 2 hit dice (75 XP) with an armor class of 14 (11) and having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or greater, there will be a kobold king of 3 hit dice (145 XP) who wears chain mail with an armor class of 15 (11) and has a movement rate of 10' and a +1 bonus to damage. In the lair, kobolds never fail a morale check as long as the kobold king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a kobold king is present). A shaman is equivalent to a 1 hit die warrior kobold statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1. For XP purposes, treat the shaman as if it has a number of hit dice equal to its clerical level -1, and assign one special ability bonus asterisk.",
      "Kobolds are sometimes confused with barklings, for whom they have a particular hatred; calling a kobold a barkling or suggesting that the two species are related is considered a terrible insult."

If a medusa sees its own reflection, it must save vs. Petrify itself; a petrified medusa is no longer able to petrify others, but the face of a medusa continues to possess the power to petrify even after death otherwise. Medusae instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror she may see her reflection.",

They can hold their breath for up to an hour of light activity, or two turns (20 minutes) of strenuous action. However, being out of water more than two turns (20 minutes) causes the mermaid 1d4 points of damage per turn.",

This means that mermaids can learn to communicate with dolphins and whales; at least 35% of mermaids will know the language of one or the other, and 10% can communicate with any such creature.",
      "Three-quarters of mermaid births are female. Of the quarter which are male, most have legs rather than tails. Such will either be slain or put ashore to be adopted by humans, depending on the temperament of the mother. Mermen (those born with tails) are raised to be subservient to the females. A small mermaid community (3d6 including the male) will often form around such a merman and his mother, who becomes their leader. Such a group is called a pod.",

Adventurers generally meet mermaids only in groups of one or two.",

      "Giant rhagodessas are the size of a pony. Those found in desert terrain are generally marked in yellow, red, and brown, while those found underground may be black or white in color (those found in the deepest caverns are always white). Like spiders, they can climb walls, but they are unable to cross ceilings or otherwise climb entirely upside down.",
      "A hit by a leg does no damage, but the victim is stuck fast and will be drawn to the rhagodessa's mouth on the next round and automatically hit for 2d8 points of damage; this repeats each round, so long as the victim is held. Escaping from the sticky hold requires a successful roll to open doors. If both legs hit, this roll frees the victim from just one of them; a second roll is needed to fully escape, and of course the rhagodessa can simply attack again with the free leg on the next round. Alternately, victims may attack with small or medium melee weapons, and in fact gain a bonus of +2 to the attack roll if a small weapon is used. If the giant rhagodessa is slain, any held victim can be freed with the open doors roll mentioned above (and in this case another character can help, making the roll for the victim).",
      "The rhagodessa seems unable to use its bite attack against a foe it has not captured in this way, and neither will it attack more than one foe with its legs. If threatened, a rhagodessa which has captured a victim will attempt to withdraw to consume its prey in peace."

When a living creature contacts an area (dung heap, offal, etc) infested with rot grubs, the grubs will attack if they can come in contact with the victim’s skin. A rot grub secretes an anesthetic when it bites and will burrow into the flesh. A burrowing grub can be noticed if the victim makes a successful save vs. Death Ray with Wisdom bonus applied in order to notice a strange rippling beneath their skin. Otherwise, the victim does not notice the grubs. During the first two rounds, a burrowing rot grub can be killed by applying fire to the infested skin or by cutting open the infested skin with any slashing weapon. Either method deals 1d8 points of damage to the victim, but kills the grubs. After the second round, only <strong>cure disease</strong> can kill the grubs before they burrow to the victim’s heart and devour it in 1d3 turns."

      "The touch of any part of a rust monster's body oxidizes metal objects instantly, turning them to rust, verdigris, or other oxides as appropriate. One attacks with its antennae, brushing them over metal items. Non-magical metal attacked by a rust monster, or that touches the monster (such as a sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined. A hit with a non-magical metal weapon inflicts half damage before the weapon is destroyed. Magic weapons or armor permanently lose one \"plus\" each time they make contact with the monster.",
      "The metal oxides created by this monster are its food; a substantial amount of metal dropped in its path may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored characters. Use a morale check to determine this. Metals that do not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of no interest to a rust monster and will be ignored. While rust monsters will consume oxides of silver or copper, they have a strong preference for ferrous metals (iron or steel), preferring them over any other metal.",

In addition to attacking, a sand salamander can temporarily transform any stone within a 20 foot radius into sand. Characters in the affected area must save vs. Paralysis each round in order to move through the sand, and if the save is successful, the character is still reduced to half their normal movement. Whenever the sand salamander moves out of range, the sand \"congeals\" back into stone, and any character in the affected area must save vs. Paralysis or become trapped. Extraction of a trapped person may take quite a long time, chipping and hammering at the stone to break it apart.",

      "A strangle vine (sometimes called an assassin vine) is a strange animated plant found in temperate and tropical forests, particularly in areas with poor-quality soil. They fertilize their soil by entangling, constricting, and killing living creatures, then depositing the bodies in loose soil around the plant's base.",
      "Because it can lie very still indeed, a strangle vine surprises on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. A successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the victim becomes entangled, suffering an additional 1d8 points of damage thereafter. A victim may attempt to escape by rolling a saving throw vs. Death Ray with Strength bonus added; this is a full action, so the victim may not attempt this and also perform an attack. The plant will continue to crush its victim until one or the other is dead or the victim manages to escape.",
      "Strangle vines are actually mobile, able to uproot themselves and move slowly from place to place; one generally only does so to seek new hunting grounds. They have no visual organs but can sense foes within 30 feet by sound and vibration.",
      "Each plant consists of a single long vine of up to 20 feet in length, with many smaller vines 5 feet or so in length packed closely, two vines per foot or thereabouts. The smaller vines are covered in leaves, and in the fall they bear clusters of reddish-purple berries which are tough and bitter but not poisonous.",
      "There is a similar plant found in underground environments which has leaves the color of iron with pale shiny metallic veins. They grow near geothermal vents or springs, and the rotting flesh that surrounds them often supports mushrooms of various sizes and types. This fungal growth conceals the strangle vine, allowing it to surprise on 1-5 on 1d6 as does the above-ground variety of the plant."

Otherwise, it continues to eat the corpse of the slain victim for 1d4 turns."

      "Treants are a race of large, roughly humanoid tree-people. When one stands still with its legs together it cannot be easily distinguished from a normal oak tree. Their leaves are nearly identical to oak leaves, and are green in spring and summer, turning orange, red, or yellow in the fall and winter. A treant's leaves do not normally fall out in the winter, but as some oaks also retain their leaves into cold weather this may not help in identifying one.",
      "Being actual trees, treants are big, averaging 25 to 35 feet in height and weighing 4,000 to 5,000 pounds. Their language is difficult for most other races to learn, though Elves are known to have an advantage in mastering it. Many treants know Elvish, and some who live near humans learn Common as well.",
      "Treants are slow to act when potential enemies are nearby, preferring watch them carefully before taking any action. Because of their excellent camouflage treants gain surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.",
      "All treants have the power to animate other normal trees in their area; up to two trees can be animated at once, but the treant can release one and animate another if needed. Trees to be animated must be within 180 feet of the treant, and must remain within that range or they will return to their normal state. An animated tree requires a full round to uproot itself before it can move around, and then can move at a rate of just 10' per round. Of course, if enemies are within reach the animated tree need not be uprooted. If the treant controlling an animated tree is slain or incapacitated, the tree returns to its normal state.",
      "Note that animated trees will automatically root themselves when returning to their normal, dormant state; if such a tree finds itself on stone or some other surface it cannot penetrate, it will move around randomly for 1d6 rounds until it accidentally finds a suitable area, or failing that, until it topples and falls. Any character or creature nearby when this happens must save vs. Death Ray to scamper away; those who fail will suffer 2d6 points of damage and will be trapped under the fallen tree. The GM should consider battlefield conditions when deciding on the exact results of such an event."

    "description_paragraphs": [
      "Vampires are <strong>undead</strong> monsters. Though they may look just a bit more pale than when they were alive, they do appear to live and even breathe as mortals do. A vampire has all the memories and abilities it had in life, and is effectively immortal. Living forever in the shadows often leads to vampires being decadent, while their hunger for blood makes them cruel.",
      "Vampires cast no reflections in silvered mirrors or water, though despite conventional wisdom to the contrary they do reflect in shiny base metals; the innate purity of silver and water simply will not reflect them.",
      "A vampire can charm anyone who meets its gaze; a save vs. Spells is allowed to resist, but at a penalty of -2 due to the power of the charm. This charm is so powerful that the victim will not resist being bitten by the vampire.",
      "The bite inflicts 1d3 points of damage, then each round thereafter one energy level is drained from the victim. The vampire regenerates (i.e. is healed) for up to 1d6 hit points for each energy level drained. If the victim dies from the energy drain, they will arise as a vampire at the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later) and thereafter will be under the complete control of the \"parent\" vampire (but is freed if that vampire is ever destroyed).",
      "If using the bite attack, the vampire suffers a penalty of -5 to Armor Class due to the vulnerable position it must assume. For this reason, the bite is rarely used in combat. Vampires have great Strength, gaining a bonus of +3 to damage when using melee weapons, and thus a vampire will generally choose to use a melee weapon (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than attempting to bite.",
      "Vampires are unharmed by non-magical weapons, and like all undead are immune to <strong>sleep</strong>, <strong>charm</strong>,<strong> </strong>and <strong>hold </strong>spells. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the vampire is not destroyed, though it may appear to be. The vampire will begin to regenerate 1d8 hours later, recovering 1 hit point per turn, and resuming normal activity as soon as the first point is restored.",
      "Creatures of the night obey vampires. Once per day a vampire can call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats, 10d10 bats, 3d6 giant bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves (assuming any such creatures are nearby). The creatures summoned arrive 2d6 rounds later and will obey the vampire for up to an hour before leaving.",
      "Vampires can also transform into the form of these creatures, assuming the shape of a giant bat (page 66), giant rat (page 136), or a dire wolf (page 159) at will. The transformation requires a single round during which the vampire cannot attack. The flying movement given above is for the giant bat form; the vampire can use the attack forms of the animal shape assumed, as given on the indicated pages. The vampire cannot activate any of its other powers while in animal form, but effects already active will remain so.",
      "Vampires are powerful indeed, but they do have several specific weaknesses.",
      "First, a vampire can be <strong>held at bay</strong> by several things, including the smell of garlic, a silver or silvered mirror, or a holy symbol presented by a believer (GM's discretion is advised here, but in general someone threatened by a vampire may be more devout than usual). In such a situation the vampire cannot approach within 5 feet of the repellent item or character, nor can it make any melee attacks or otherwise touch those within the warded area.",
      "<strong>Running water</strong> (such as a stream or river) acts as a barrier to a vampire; one cannot cross over any such waterway, neither by bridge or by waterway or even by flying. It is possible for a vampire to be carried across while lying in its own coffin with the lid closed; the presence of the water flowing beneath the coffin will force the vampire to remain dormant.",
      "Finally, a vampire may not enter any private dwelling without being invited by someone who resides there, and then only if invited while the resident is actually inside the structure. Public buildings of any sort do not present this problem; even inns are fully accessible to a vampire.",
      "<strong>Destroying a vampire </strong>is not an easy task. When reduced to zero hit points or less a vampire becomes incapacitated but is not slain (as previously explained). <strong>If exposed to direct sunlight</strong>, the vampire will be utterly destroyed in a single round if it cannot find a way to escape in that time. <strong>Being immersed in running water</strong> (as defined above) causes 3d8 points of damage each round, and if reduced to zero or fewer hit points in this way the vampire is destroyed. If the vampire is <strong>cremated in a funeral pyre</strong> while in any dormant state it will be destroyed.",
      "The most dramatic method of defeating a vampire is actually the least reliable: <strong>driving a wooden stake through its heart</strong>. Doing this will instantly reduce the vampire to zero hit points, and it will remain \"dead\" for so long as the stake is present. Removal of the stake, however, allows the vampire to begin regenerating as described above. It is not normally possible to drive a stake through a vampire's heart while it is actively resisting, but this can be done after reducing the monster to zero hit points in the usual way. Of course, after staking a vampire it is possible to use sunlight, running water, or a funeral pyre as described above to complete its destruction."

Sperm whales can emit an invisible focused beam of sound 5' wide up to a 50' range underwater. This blast of sound disorients target creatures, leaving them effectively stunned for 1d4 rounds. A stunned character can neither move nor take action for the indicated duration. No attack roll is required, but a save vs. Death Ray is allowed to resist. A sperm whale can emit as many such blasts of sound as it desires, once per round, instead of biting."
